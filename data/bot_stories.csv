1|I'm not in the business of trying to explain why or how it doesn't work. But I think it's important that we figure out solutions. I think you need to remember how important it is to give people access to the information they need.Is it about getting to know them and knowing what they want to learn?[laughs.] yeah, I think the biggest problem with that is that you want people to know it's just one piece. If you had a computer, and you looked at the table, you were able to see if you could figure out what they were doing or not using their laptop. You also could see what was happening in their eyes that were seeing the information that they saw. If you were able to tell them the whole picture, you really had a huge advantage.How would you describe them—when you're looking at them in the car?I don't want to go into specifics. We all try to keep things simple and keep things a little more in order than what we should be looking at. But the thing is, when you're looking at a car, at least in certain corners, your eyes tend to be focused more toward the camera. When you're looking at them in the garage, your eyes tend to be focused more toward the computer and the camera. But if you're looking at this car that has a computer and the camera, your eyes are all focused toward the camera. So...
2|Just a friend, a friend. I was about to leave when I got the phone call. I don't remember anything. I don't get any type of help. My head was shaking. Just getting to know my family. I'm trying to look after the kids and just keep them going. It was my first call. I was nervous because I was a little shy and I needed to protect my kids. Then my sister called. She said, "Oh my mom died, it's your mom for sure." I said, "So did I do?" She said, "You need someone to look after my kids." I said, "No one's ever seen your kids here." She said, "Oh my god." At the time, there was no news about my illness. I just went and got my friends and my wife. I was lucky. It was one of the happiest times of my life.After that, I was able to say goodbye. I was able to thank my wife for being there for me. She's such a loving person.I will continue with my story next time I get home.As always, we hope to see you here at our facebook page. Enjoy it!– andre...
1|i was sitting in my parents' little house at the time. Our bedroom was huge, so we had two beds with two bedrooms, and a bathroom. The kitchen was just as big as the bedroom, and there was a bathtub. And at the end of the day, it was beautiful. It was perfect. It was a lovely little house. I just loved the house."His mother said that when he was four, he was told to "Go away and get a job at a restaurant or something and take up with a guy. That's what he did. I had no idea it was so common. He worked his way up in education. His name was johnny. He had his own little magazine, called the johnny, and he was named johnny because he had his hair up in a ponytail, and his eyebrows were a little higher than most guys. If you weren't like him, you wouldn't have been able to be a star. He didn't have that much luck. And then he was a millionaire, and he was able to get some money out of that. He had a real family. He did all of that. He had a family of his own. He lived in a couple places in the states, and his brother, johnny depp, had a house on his side of the world."After living with the family for five years, johnny depp said, he said that it was hard to get by in america...
2|I was very nervous that I would be killed, because you know, it isn't your fault. I didn't know. You know, when I was young, nobody cared. They only cared about the children. If you ever saw kids and they just looked at us, we just didn't care.And so we just wanted a little bit of freedom, and we were very careful with it. We put it all together. And I think we made it.The only problem is that we didn't even come close to getting what we wanted. We didn't even get what we really wanted. When we were kids. When we went to college, we didn't come up with anything. So you have to give up something that you really really want, because if you don't give up something, the situation ends.What I did, and I think now I did, was make a little bit of money. We made a small profit for the next two years. Not that we were even there for that. I just gave it up on a whim because I thought it would get us a little bit of a break before we had time for retirement.But then we took a step back, and we were like, "Oh my god, we're in here, we know we're doing this." We were kind of living in a bubble. It felt like the whole world just was in a bubble.And then I started giving kids wha...
3|I don't know anybody who had to put in the work of getting up at 7am. I didn't want to work late. I was bored. I wanted to go to london and spend the night. My boss saw me and said, 'i'm going to do this again.' It was a good way to work during the day and not late. And he went back to work and I said, 'yes, I will. You have to go.'"The whole project was a little bit of a rollercoaster. We were working for three months and in the middle of it, I had no money and I was worried about my time. I'd been working hard in the pub for a number of years and I wasn't going home for the summer. I felt that I was no longer a regular member of the pub. People came and said to me: 'are you kidding? You're the only one who's ever felt like you were going to get hit by a car in london when you were five years old.' I felt that I was getting hit by a car once because I had never been here before. Then, suddenly, I felt like I was going to be the hero. And so it was such a relief."I knew that I would do well in the team. The team is going to be in there for a while after the summer. We don't go so close to making the big move but our manager told me, ...
4|My name is kori. We are both men in our teen years, and my partner is a young woman. We're like a couple. We went to a lot of festivals, but we never knew each other back then. My sister was just about to leave school with us. She was really happy about school, but her mom told me that she liked to go to college where she didn't have to work hard on homework. She told me that we were like kids, but we're not. Our parents were always very supportive of us, and we had an easy life, but we never knew each other. And then one night, our mother came over to me and asked if kori would like to see my boyfriend. I told her that I wanted to wait until she had finished her homework to hear that out loud. Kori was nervous, but her mom was supportive and kind. So I told her I got my boyfriend and we went upstairs and stayed there for about a month. So I'm here in my apartment, and you can see the room. And what really amazed me is how my life started, we were living together for about ten months or more. It was so exciting to have our families around because we loved life together. And we were all really happy together. What was it like for you? I didn't really know, what kind of girls my whole life was like. But our lives were happy. It was so simple. It was just fun. S...
5|The day we started, the police were calling us into their office," He said. "We were walking away from the office in a hurry. We didn't know what to do with ourselves because we were getting shot in the back of the head, or maybe the bullet wound up the back of my head by a shot to the head." The woman in the video, who asked to remain anonymous because she wants the identity of the person who shot her, said she didn't know who shot the man or the woman.It was a rare scene, he said, and his family was in the process of grieving for what they lost."They were like, 'what if we didn't get shot in the back of my head,' " He said. "But it wasn't like that. It was a whole new world in my life. I've never seen anything like this. I'll miss everyone at work at work. Even my sister is a big cheerleader. I'm just sad to miss my wife and kids. I hope everything just stays the same in our lives....
6|It happened last year with our first president. The president was running for re-election after a bad election and he lost. He lost a lot less than he was trying to win. He campaigned in one place, and he got out in the third. We ran a campaign that got out in one place. And he failed. I don't understand why he was running in the third. It's not like he had any other strategy. He had no other plan. So even though he was not, he didn't get a call. So, we spent the next week campaigning. And that was a big mistake. And it was a big mistake, because no one saw the results and didn't have a second thought about what was happening. We spent a lot of time on that side of the fence in iowa, and it worked out, but nobody realized. So we started talking about this, and I was really concerned about what would happen if that happened to me. So we tried to get some help, and then we went to iowa and tried to find help that we could get to. And we found some things that we could talk about. We made some statements. And so, we began to work on that side of the fence, but we ended up on the wrong side of the fence.So I think the reason my own party is doing this is because they've got so many problems. They've got so many problems in the white house. A lot of the problem...
7|My father did not have the means to buy a car or truck and I had to spend nearly two years digging through the rubble of our home, only to discover a beautiful building in our backyard that held thousands of dollars in my pockets, my father's old auto loan account and two houses in a big cul-de-sac. Every minute spent in this field and in the next three years, I would come home to a massive pile of rubble. Not a single house, not even a home that had its roof covered. That is where my dad gave up his home.Why did he lose his home? It was because he was too old to drive the vehicle, because his car had run out of fuel and his brother had gone missing. What happened? Was his mother forced to sell him or was his father forced to sell him to get his money back?My father was an ordinary man with a simple life. He was a farmer. He had made a living playing the black game. I mean, no, because, I mean, he did. In fact, it is a story that has been told in every single corner of my home. Why did you go to any of these places to get your income, to make a living working on your farm? And then you couldn't get enough of this? How did you get enough of this? Why were you compelled to go anywhere and put everything you had into this endeavor?It was all in vain...
8|I saw this man walking past some guys and I said, "Are you ok?" And he said, "Uh…" And I said, "Yeah, it's just me and my sister."We were talking about my grandmother at a restaurant called the bar. She was sitting at a table with two young girls talking. It was an old bar that was about a year old. She asked one of the girls, "Do you know how much alcohol you have in your house?" And the one of the girls said, "Nope. You don't drink for a while." And so that's the first time I got to know her. So there was a lot of emotion for her.In retrospect, it's probably an insult to her that she still has a daughter today. I'm not aware if she would have gotten that kind of emotional support after the violence that she suffered. But i've learned that it wasn't because of her. She had a relationship with a girl who was not her own parent at the time, so maybe she's not aware of it when she gets home.How far from that her child will gothere were a lot of questions about how far from her that she would reach. There were a lot of questions about where she would be going, where she would be getting help. And there were a lot of questions about where she would be finding solace, where she would be finding herself. I was always wondering ho...
9|one of the most memorable moments of this game was when you could tell you were making a cutscene with a character, a character that you never made with any previous video game, but which somehow managed to remain at that moment that was completely different. There was never any need to make a save, or any previous save, and instead the game was a little longer than the cutscene you'd seen. In fact, I think this is because a very important thing was getting a save from the game and when you see these images you immediately recognize them as the cutscenes.When a video game is more powerful than it is, you see these other people, they are playing video games, and they all seem to be in the same position, playing video games, and there's a sense of, "Oh, well, they have some sort of a relationship with this person." That's what you see.If you were to open your laptop and try to watch tv, and you looked at those tv ads that all featured these other characters, you would see this tiny little camera on the screen, and the screen would come with an image that looked like this, then you would see a shot that looked like this, and then you'd see the other characters looking at this image. That was what made this game so unique.I remember being really excited about this, because we knew we had some really cool things to do with it – we had to d...
10|in the middle of the early 2000s, an oil spill in florida turned into a major international economic disaster, and there is no way to predict how the disaster will spill across the u.S.The next decade or so will be the first of many, if not the most, disasters with massive effects on the economy and the lives of untold numbers of workers.The biggest effects are in the energy sector, where there will be thousands of jobs lost every year. The energy industry is a $12 trillion industry — and the jobs in it will be wiped out by what is known as the clean power plan — which is what will result.The clean power plan is the most important environmental program in u.S. History, and the second of its kind. It set a dangerous temperature cap, put the nation's power grids on alert, and made it possible for thousands of fossil fuel companies to burn off their dirty energy.Today's disasters will be catastrophic for the country, the world, and the planet.It is impossible to know all the facts about the situation until you have been informed by experts, lawyers, the press, and even the best scientists within the oil and gas industry.I would not presume to be able to predict what will happen from the air at a national level.My best guess is that the next big disaster will be a spill from a natural gas well that could cause a massive leak out int...
11|The first thing you see and hear is the blood. You've heard it all too often. It's always something you hear for hours. You might never see it again. But you can't let it ruin you. You know how hard it is to get up in the morning. You get in the morning and go outside and have fun.This is an old proverb and a long one. It still says "Every day, there's a little bit better than the sun." The world is constantly turning to look for good things. If your job is to be smart, your family is your only bread and butter. No one has to work to be smart.I have always known this proverb when it was first uttered. It has since been taught to some of my best friends. When some of them have had a lot of work done, but the next day just go out and drive all around town, and you're not in that area, nobody cares who you are. When a friend recently told me the story of how he came up with the idea for this joke, I knew I was in for a surprise. Everyone who heard the story told a story about how they really felt. And it all went by without a hitch.I never had a job. After graduating from college, I worked in a restaurant for a week when I was just about to graduate from law school. I was a lawyer, and I took the law school job I got. N...
12|You were on my flight from new york. I had a meeting with my mother and dad. I was at an airport and I saw a girl in a bikini. I got down there and I heard an airplane. That was kind of what I did. I jumped up and saw the plane. I got up first and I heard a person on the ground, I could hear him. Just me, and two others on the ground. And I saw a woman. And I knew the girl because she looked so good."In her autobiography, young said that she believed that she was raped."If I can remember, my first impulse was to say to the boy that he's a liar and not a girl," Young recalled. "He said, 'hey, you're pretty good looking, but this is going to make me look bad.'"Her second impulse was to ask the boy: "Did you tell the police?""I don't think so. I think they told the police," Young recalled. "And they were told I'd been raped by a stranger. When I went to my room and I saw the guy, I said, 'oh, you know the reason, I thought you were going to rape me wasn't a woman. He was going to hurt her, and I'm scared to tell you that, and to tell you that I did. So I told my mom, and in the next minutes I heard him say to th...
13|It's like a big mystery.A friend of mine once asked about the "Secret recipe" For a wine.I think there was a very long story that came out, and I can't remember exactly how I knew it.But there was a bit of it, and that's why i've been writing about my relationship with booze.The only way I can tell you if you're going to make me less drunk will be if you stop reading.But I'm not too sure, what if you really are going to stop reading?...
14|A lot of the guys I have talked to who have talked to me about this have been from the gulf coast. My family has been from hawaii for a lot of years. They have been coming here for over 30 years. They grew up here. So we always had a couple more young men who came to try and live here. And we have guys who come here to help support their father and his family. We had a couple of these guys on the program today, but they didn't have any money. So all the kids who would come to try and live here, we were a little bit disappointed and we just didn't know if we'd get it. So we just kind of did it. But that's what he did. There's a lot of money here. We're just a little more focused. We have more money to spend.You're talking about people who have worked here for years. The men you're talking about are from alaska. You're talking about people who worked with you at an alaska restaurant.Exactly. And they didn't have any money at all. So that's why, you know, the thing with it is that the people you want to know about that stuff are from the gulf coast. So people will tell you that they can live here because you're from hawaii. That they won't lose a dime. That they can get a piece of your hard-earned money. Peopl...
15|I got a job as a bartender at a bar in brooklyn (in brooklyn heights) as a bartender at a bar near my parents' home. We were in a bar called the best pub in brooklyn heights where I'd try to help some people get out of their home to get more money. As a bartender, we were helping some people who were living away from their families (a couple), who were working as cleaners in a gas station. I'd try to help, but that was my job. We'd make $3-4 an hour. I told them to get out. I told them to give me something. I told them that I couldn't have things and not get stuff. He didn't want to give anything. He said, "You know what? You can take me and my kid home and go and get some things for you." He said he was going to be a bartender in a bar somewhere, and I said, "No, you can't take my kids home. I know we're going to be friends and I know if you go through this with me, you should go through a police investigation." He said, "We can go with you if you want, and I'lllet you go with us if you want." So I asked him, "But what about my kids?" And he said: "They're my kids, too." So my wife ran away. He said, "You know what I don't want? It's not fai...
16|The last year I was making movies. And at the start — I know how hollywood sometimes takes a little too much to tell a story but it's all to do with the quality of the film. So I just started talking about the kind of person you could be. And as I was learning how to talk to people, I had to realize that I was a person who could talk. But I was also learning that not everyone was like me, and I was a person who was able to say things on tape and on video so I didn't have to do that every single time.In the first four or five years it was the same story on tape. I was a pretty quiet guy so I just did my best. It wasn't that I was getting too high and I just needed to be careful about how much I told people. I just knew how to say it so I didn't give away too many details. And I had to remember to trust people. I had to trust my instincts and I had to trust my mind.It was just hard because I grew up. We were like the same age, I didn't learn anything from high school. And, obviously, I didn't grow up, but I have been growing up in hollywood now for years and years and years. I am very happy to be there. I feel very fortunate as an actor to be a part of this generation.What are you watching right now?I'...
17|in 1989, michael jackson was in an office building in a small town in kansas city called "Parks and recreation". He could not make it to the meeting with his wife and daughter.He was being asked to explain to him why the group of 20 people were going to chicago for the summer olympics, and how they will fight to be the most successful sport in american history if they wanted to win it.He'd been waiting for this ever since his dad and his brother, and had never really been a fan of the league. Then he found out that the games were on, and the local sports media knew about it. He had been there for years, and he was shocked when his parents, who had attended one of the games and had a job in his company, told him about the city's summer games being cancelled, and all the players and coaches on the teams having to fight to make the team. He was completely stunned.He had already come to this country to attend the olympics because his father, a sports editor for the times and national geographic, had worked out a deal with the chicago sun-times to put the games on schedule. The sports editor, a sports columnist for the chicago tribune, was looking for a way to keep the teams from getting canceled.Parks and recreation was supposed to be a place where people could come and watch them.When the game closed, the sun-times gave the chicago tea...
18|on the morning of july 17, 2014, I was sitting in the back of this small office at the library, doing research for a book called the god of the new testament, and I heard a huge buzz sound. It was a familiar kind of music, and I was just like, wow, this is it. That's probably the one i've been waiting all my life for.And then I realized that I had to do something. And I asked the guy I work for, the person who works for me, "What does your god like about this book?" He got back up. And then he said, "Well, well, it has some really good stuff. It's really good; it's really good and really good. And if you're not going to put up with it, you don't have to."And it's hard to find a story that's not true. You have to find a story that's real.The book he got back up was just like, great. It's like a book in between two books. It's like the bible is in between two books. And I didn't know when I got the book and what he was saying it was, but I was just like, whoa. I was like, there's a different kind of bible. There's these kind of things. I could do almost anything if I wanted to.So he said, "What are you talking abou...

20|It's not really me asking a lot of you, it's what I am telling you. I am asking for the help of a girl who loves me. I am asking for a girl who knows about me and how to love me well. I am asking for a girl who loves me and can tell me the truth about my condition.You should have heard me say in those words that this person is only going to be able to help me. You would have thought as soon as I said that I would talk to you. But my only role is to help you and to find out the truth about you that you need to hear from me now.I did it as an example for you. I just wanted you to know that if you need help I can. That is all. I am here to help you.I just want you to know that I truly like you. I am truly sorry if that is not the case at this time. I want you to know that I care about you. I really do and I will never put up with myself for not being good at finding the truth about myself that you might not even know about before.I know that when I first met you last month. I met you on your facebook page. You were talking about how much you love me. And that's really what I wanted to hear from you. I'm sorry for what you said. I want you to understand that. I want your suppor...
21|I got out of an old house in chicago and a friend told me, "A former high school coach wants my advice. He says he doesn't recommend that you go to a job where you have to win. But don't think of it as a job where you can win. Instead, you must go over to the best job you can get." For me, I went to the big jobs. I lost my whole family.I was able to go back to my family. I have three kids, but I haven't been able to go back to the family for four years. It's been crazy. I had people tell me we could not go to work, but that it's only because they can't. I don't want to go.The first time my husband had to deal with what he saw as a man who would make a poor life, he told me, "You have to be kind of self-reliant, so you can go back to home. That's the first time you know that you're never going to be able to do it."He's in jail now in illinois, so it was his problem. His wife was not being nice to him. He was saying, "But not this time," Which was an insult.But that was before he started dating. He has to go back to his family because he can't go back to his family.It's sad but you know, we hav...
22|I recently had to talk to the police about how they'd found a dead black man inside a car, where they found a bullet hole in the side of the car. They found him, but there were no bullets, and the driver wasn't wearing a seat belt."This is, of course, true. A gunshot to the head is not a cause of death.You'd think that the police would be aware of the shooting. I've interviewed several police officers who worked in the area during the early morning hours of feb. 24, 2015. The first officer I spoke to said he had never had an incident of this nature. But then I realized that there was this very common misconception of whether shooting on purpose is a cause of death, that it's just a mental illness. It's a misconception that police officers know because they're trained in that. But I think most of our police officers do.That said, what we see from the media, from our law enforcement officers, is not just the kind of violence, but the kind of mental illness that we know.The media also, obviously, ignores this, which is why, when you see what has happened, we see this behavior with this kind of racial bias and distrust and distrust. There's not a big difference. We have two very distinct and very different problems.The first is that, as you know when we talked, the police have very few resources, which means the...
23|I'm talking about the idea of the world. We live in an unbreakable bond between one another. I'll bet many of those bonds are not with you, but with your children.These two things are going to be the foundation of the entire future of the u.S. Economy. And because they're going to be here and because they've been put together in one place, it's going to be the foundation of the future. And so I hope i've convinced you that it's time to get to the bottom of what happens today.I believe this story means so much to so many people, so much to all of us.When you look at my background, I was born and raised in philadelphia's northeast, with my father in the south who was actually brought up at new york city's central park. He was an engineering major and worked for the american steelworkers. His father's house in washington d.C., when he was 11 years old, was filled with his mom's toys, but he was a big fan of the national museum of american history. One night, his father invited him to join his parents at the park and ask him to give them a tour of the exhibits.I remember my dad sitting behind me. He was so excited to be there, he really was, and he said, "Thank you for coming to see the exhibit." He also told me he would like to see my mother...
24|I'm at a bar, a friend of mine's family, which means that there's probably some sort of alcohol poisoning that I'm aware of. I just remember that for weeks we sat there drinking, and then suddenly they threw up all around us. We didn't notice anything unusual, they seemed very calm. It was like people were having a hard time finding a place to hide themselves. It was the end of the tour. I could hardly believe it. It's like some kind of crazy, insane, crazy thing.Then I remember getting in my car, I don't remember the driver going anywhere, I didn't even hear what was going on. I'm thinking that's how they went to try and stop me from getting in, but then again, maybe that's the reason I got in there. I remember the man, with his hair pulled back, his face was very red, he was talking in deep voice.So there was some kind of sudden, sudden, sudden realization that I wasn't in a good place. This was like two months since I left the gig. This was the beginning of things I would never forget, I guess."It's just what they call that weird, weird thing. They say that when you're in the studio, people can do something unusual. And when you're onstage, people can do that too, but with a little effort. You don't think that's going to get any better, yo...
25|i got into real estate. My husband got out of school, I went to an abortion. I took two jobs before I ever took any other job because I had to pay for myself and my kids.I came out of the abortion business, and I went with a different kind of idea:i want to give back to the people who have helped to pay for my own children.I didn't do that because there has been some negative impact on me in different ways in the past. But it makes me think about it more as a person.I wanted to take a different position every day, and I did. I wanted to do it so that my children never have to struggle. It has been an amazing experience to be able to have the support of the families who have helped me pay my mortgage. There are still people who can't make it through the process. Just like when you go back out to the grocery store and you see a bag of flour that says, "Just give me that," Just because you've put it in a bag doesn't mean you can't make it again.I still have this feeling when I walk into my office, and it's like, "I took 20 years to get through it. I just want to take it back for what it was."The story of how I made my decision to become a parent and do this is important. Sometimes when we talk about getting married an...
26|If you're like me, you have trouble believing that they actually knew about this. Even though they were saying it, it was very real information, so to speak. It was really scary.""Who's behind the fake stories?""I haven't spoken to them. Not even once," I said. I didn't want the truth to get out, I told myself. I felt like my mind was racing. They just wanted this kind of information. That was the reason why I was scared as an adult. I felt bad for them and wanted to leave the country, but then I realized that the people at the top were so ignorant. They were only trying to sell the money to other countries and make a quick buck. If I could keep my promise and get them to tell me about the money, I probably would. If they didn't, it would be too embarrassing for me. Even though I know, the government doesn't trust me. They think they know everything, but then they've never tested me before.""You know what, you're right. You were talking to someone very nice.""Yes." I laughed, "And that's because I knew it. The people who knew about our past, too, so they didn't know about my past, either.""Do you mean that to say I'm a liar? And I don't know why you didn't lie before you left?""...

28|on an evening in february of 2012 in oakland, I headed off to my favorite restaurant, la jolla's, to sample their delicious food and its amazing ambience. This was the beginning of a three week long trip that would last about two weeks.At first, we had very little to go on. We were just going to go to the bar, and to the place for drinks. That had nothing to do with the restaurants where the people were going. It was just because I was young, and I was at the bar with my friends. We were on the couch, and at each of the tables there was a small round table with an open door into, and I could see the faces of them all.So, the idea came to play out: I'd show up and walk out of the bar with the bartender behind me. And that was exactly what happened in oakland.I saw these people in the bar, but I wasn't going to hear the music. They were just talking at the bar, and I just didn't see the music either. So, I looked down and saw a giant lightbulb. In the middle of it it was a man with a mustache. When I tried to talk to him, he said to look at the lightbulb. And I said, oh my god; look at this huge lightbulb. And I could hear the man's voice, and I heard the man's voice a...
29|When we were growing up, we saw our grandfather's family. They lived in the area. He'd always been raised in our school. I remember that our father never went out to eat. He went in with his mom. We never had a table for dinner. That's what it was like in those days.That's why I'm glad he was able to get a job, the job that i've never had. That's his big dream. That's his big dream. I didn't know what it would be like to have him there. I don't know. Maybe no one had the same dream. And I believe that he's going to keep going.But I just don't know how to deal with what's right and wrong and how to address anything that might come up. I've tried to tell myself that it's just a matter of time before I find a new job or move. This is my family. This is my family.So I will keep saying that he was a successful athlete, and he was a great father. That's not going to happen.He said that if he was to tell someone else, he would tell them how he was raised. That's not going to happen. No matter how you deal with that. You're not going to get a better person in the world, right? You're not going to be the world's best person. I never want to see that. That's ...
30|back in november, I went to the local walmart and went through the first five of them. In that store, at 12:00am, they were kind of closing and I was in front of a big cardboard box of food with a big food cart with lots of fruit and vegetables and rice. They had cut my lunch food into small bits and put them in the freezer with a bit of fruit and then put you at the counter and you'd be gone for the next five minutes. That's what happens when you go to a grocery store and you're not in their grocery store. There was the kind of store where everything you wanted in that store was cut from something and you had no money. There's a lot of things that you can buy from that store, and in fact, there were some of the things that you might want to get at that store.How many times have you been to a grocery store and seen a giant bag of crap?Well, let's say you went to one of those stores and one of them had a big bag of groceries. That particular store was huge, and there was a big bag of groceries inside that bag. That thing, it was a huge bag of groceries. They could've packed it into a box and put it at the back of a large, sturdy box. So my mom, when I went to the walmart, I had a huge bag of groceries and it was the same thing.Wha...
31|In 1991, after I was in graduate school, I went to work for a local news station in the district. It was a bad news story. My friend called me and asked me to come to the news bureau of his news station. I didn't want to go and work for him, so I called him and asked if he wanted to talk. When we left the news bureau, we had a small newsroom in the station's room, and when the news bureau manager saw me coming out of the building, he said he couldn't wait to see me and then he called the newsroom and told me to come back and do the same job. So I came back and did it.I was surprised that he did that. In fact, when I was working there, I was working at a small newsroom. Every day as the newsman I had this "Newsroom look" There. They had a lot of big photos and they didn't have time to use them. So every day I had to use them. I don't remember how long it was. But in my head, I knew that I wasn't going anywhere.My first job as a local newsroom reporter was when I was at a newsroom. Then, in 1995, I was hired as an investigative photographer at an affiliate. The affiliate called the affiliate the "Local newsroom." I was a reporter in the local office and they told me what to look for, what to loo...

34|A friend was trying to get me to write an essay about the past while I was in the philippines.I don't remember that, but he was on his way to a movie theater when he and I got to the top floor and all of a sudden he was in a cab with a guy.When he came out of the cab to check in, the cab driver had his hand on his pants, his hand on his hip, he was like, "Why are you here?"And he said, "The guy here is trying to kill me." So we walked down the street to the other side of the building, and the dude was trying to kill me.And I say this, because he was trying to kill me. So I say, "Well, I don't want to die. I want to be out of there."So he was getting hit. And as soon as he was hit—(laughter)and he went to his bag, he had his hand on my crotch, and he hit me in the thigh and the next thing you know I was running, and he hit me at top speed—like I was on drugs, and I was in an alley, so I just kind of jumped on him—and then I felt him roll down and hit me, and it just broke his leg.So he was gone.I was walking back and he started hitting m...

36|I was living alone in lubbock, texas, and was just trying to make ends meet and, well, my family had been through the hard times. Our family is of about 20 children, of which six are children with disabilities. In 2004 I had my first child named, a boy named j.C.B., and I had a little boy named j.A. He was 12, and we were just trying to get him to learn how to play basketball. And it just turned out to be such a great challenge for him. And so I went through the whole thing and just got him ready to go. So it was amazing. It was a great story. He was so excited about the sport and about life and his mother's life, about living with her, about her amazing life -- living with her and my parents, that's how I got him to do it. And it turned out, because he'd heard about my father having a heart condition and decided, "Well, I'm lucky, I'm so lucky." So all the things that he's told me, those three things have given me so much to learn about how to play basketball. And he really loved this sport. And so I spent years helping him learn how to play basketball.That's what it was all about. And I would say it wasn't about just coaching, or just being good at the game. It was about being a family guy. And that's what I thin...
37|I have had some problems with my job but at least I'm in charge of making sure there are lots of opportunities when the time comes. I would love you to be involved with a local business as the president of the board.""So you're going to help me? You're going to help me be an adviser to the president?""Of course. Of course. How can I help you in the best way?""Well."He looked at the president and said: "You can tell me what you're thinking. If I'm looking up to him, then I'm looking at them, too. If I'm a member of his administration, I'm looking at the president. If he's a partner in a government endeavor, then I'm looking at you, too.""Of course I am." The president looked at him."I'm sure I'llfind it easy," He said."I'm sure. You want to go on your own in that way?""But I don't want to make it look difficult. I don't want to make it look like I'm trying to help somebody and then some.""I want to see them." The president said slowly."I see you can't help but look at the president and say, 'why does that look so easy to you?' When you're looking at me, it looks so easy to yo...
38|The first time I saw it, I was so disappointed. A young boy came over and kissed me, and told me that he had asked his uncle's sister to make him his new father. He promised that his mother would be with him when he was seventeen, and he would go along with her to his parents' house. I was so moved by his words, that I asked the father if he would like to make a few bucks, and he said, "I'll do it." I didn't even know what he meant, but he did say he would take me to the house."The story of the two sons is a wonderful one. I was so upset when I heard those things about the family. I was so mad when I saw the little boy kissing his uncle so fondly. I was so embarrassed by my reaction that I called his parents with this story. I went home and watched the movie and told them that they could have found out what those two boys were up to. I don't know if the father and mother were really aware, but I think it was the idea of having no one on a farm when I was a child.The family grew up in a very poor family, which was very bad. They had no money, they have nothing, they grew up with no money and there was no food. Everything they had was put together for their own amusement. My father was not happy with their household. He told me, "Loo...

40|First, I was a child and I was walking through the house when I spotted a deer. I jumped on it, threw it between his legs, and it took a long time to see who was behind the deer, but I got close enough to catch it.It is a beautiful little deer that has been in my house for 30 years and has been seen around town. It was very young when I saw it, but we kept it on the edge for a few days and then the deer was shot.The second day my wife and I saw it. She gave it a spin, then took it to the vet. I told her that I think it was one of those beautiful young deer that is one of the most valuable. She said, "Oh, that's right. It is one of those deer that you go out hunting for and you see it coming off my property, it has got a very good coat, great head, it's got great fur, it's a great spot for deer. It has a nice little head, nice big head, big tail, I told her about it.I told her, "You see, you do not need to worry about it. I am not concerned with that. It is a great deer. We do not have any problems with it."She said I told her about the deer and I didn't need to worry about it, just look at the color of the fur, the fur o...
41|I was born with a pretty big brain. I would watch a lot of commercials and read old books. And I would be reading about history. I loved american culture in my teens. I didn't look at any historical articles. I just sat around my room eating lunch and watching the tv and reading books. But when I was 16 I saw the world through my eyes. And I saw the world through my eyes in the right way every single day.But I was also going through the trouble of getting an education. I had a lot of friends in college. Most of them had already gone to high school, and I was going through school like a kid in high school. But the other girls didn't. So I sat there and had to learn the way I wanted to be educated. I was so afraid of what I was going to do. I was scared that what I was going to do at a young age would make me a bad teacher.But I knew I wanted to learn to be a good teacher and be the best teacher I could be. I had a lot to learn, really. And my whole life was focused on one thing: being a good teacher. So I said, "Yes, I will teach you my job." I made that a lifelong dream. I learned so much that day. Not that I would ever use that as a career goal, but I wanted to teach so badly. Because my goal was to be a good teacher...
42|It's not like we're having dinner at the same restaurant every week and we're having a good time. We're talking about how to get the best food we can to get the most bang for our buck.We're talking about it like we have a kid. It is such a beautiful thing, and it's been beautiful, and it's not like the food is bad. And it is. And we're both living our lives the way you grow up—just with our heads full of information in that we are so far ahead of you in it.I think it's really important to know, because i've been trying to put together a plan for this, but, I just want to say thank you very much for the time you've given me. It's a huge help in that we're going to be doing this for this year. And it's really a huge help in taking care of myself because there are so many things I can do that you don't have to do at home. And you're going to get better. And I'm gonna be honest with you—ricky: yeah.David: you might not even be the smartest guy on the planet to put it in your head. But I think it's amazing what you can do.Ricky: oh, absolutely.David: thank you so much for your time. I hope you feel the same.Ric...
43|The problem is, you get to play for 12 hours a day, every single day.There's always been a reason why we play on the bus. It's because you're driving in the right conditions, because you're using the right car and your engine is a different one. That's why we play at the city and people don't think we're like the next big team.When I got to london, we had people who were looking for a place to get to sleep and it turned out that there were no people with access, and so my friends and I were at one of those people who had a hotel waiting for us and the hotel manager and he said, "Let's go to this hotel and I'llgive you an invite, we're not going to tell you what time." So we went over the hotel's rules and they weren't going to tell us where it was. If they did tell us where it was, then there would be no way we'd be able to meet everybody there. But then people would know.There have been people who've had a stroke and died from it, they've gone into cardiac arrest. They say, "What does it mean to live in such a state of mental distress?"People say, "You should never leave your job because mental collapse can be deadly."I've got a friend who's had heart attacks at 17 and he has a stroke at 30. He's ha...
44|I am in the middle of something. When I'm about to be arrested on suspicion of murder, when I'm on my way home from a meeting, I get an email from a lawyer representing me. I am told that the judge has ordered my arrest. He wants to get his way, and has told me that he wants to release me immediately, but he wants me put in prison. We've been through it together. I've been waiting. I get in his car and we talk as if it's a new trial. It's an open plea agreement. He tells me that he will keep me here for as long as he wants to give me the maximum amount of time that I want, but I will have to find new counsel. And I'm going to have to bring him a lawyer, which I find very difficult due to the fact that the prosecutor has so many different things that they don't understand, but I have to get a lawyer. And it's going to be a tough fight.Amy goodman: you've been in contact with people who are representing you and who want to help you. Can you speak specifically about your experience at the trial of david quist?Daniel devon peck: well, it was hard. I was in a coma for three weeks. There was a lot of suffering, but they couldn't understand me. That was like a nightmare. I was very vulnerable. My mother was a little bit ill...
45|On may 12, 2014, a couple of friends from another local college decided to move to austin in search of a better education. That's when I started looking into this whole area. The university is really like a school where everybody has their own place. You are the only one of your kind. And this is where you are all different. They are all connected. I am not just saying this, everybody has their own place. That's why I came to austin to look for this place.My journey started as a student at austin international school. I began by staying in school before starting college for the first time. I thought it was a great place for me to learn. I also felt really good about my journey. I was very happy at the school. I felt happy that I was doing what I did best in college and that the school was the right place for me to do it. I felt even more happy by working here. I worked hard and got ahead with my dream.When I started college in austin university, there was a lot of noise there. The only thing you could hear was the traffic. It was raining, the people were getting drunk. I thought I was going to end up here and there. But I was really feeling that the noise made me feel bad. Everyone was telling me I was too young and I should get out of here. And it did not mean things could get better. I didn't want to end up at th...
46|I went to the office of the secretary of state and I asked to go to the state department as I had told the secretary. She said no, i've been given the option of going to the state department. So we were given a copy of the letter and went off.Juan gonzález: so that information that you were given in the state department, which was from the secretary of state, the letter you received, which was a copy of which is what led to this investigation, was all the information that you would have had?Barbara fernandez: it was all information that I had. But it was all that information that I could have at that time, and that was when I decided that I wanted to go to the justice department and I was going to go to justice department. It was all of that in order to get my information to the bureau.Juan gonzález: so that was the beginning of that process?Barbara fernandez: exactly. I knew that it would be the only way to get more information. Before the end of the investigation I had done all the vetting, but when I got there I was actually allowed to go and work with all of the senior staff members here. And I was asked at the time what was going on, and I said, I am telling you, but that will not b...
47|One day, I was sitting in the garage, staring at the windows.I didn't know what it was about then.I could tell that the lights would turn on when it was night.And we would start to walk along the road, with headlights and the engine going on.My friends would sit down and they would be waiting for the car to come out.In between, they would be sitting in their favorite recliner, and watching us.And then I would go and find out how it was.That was when I was on my way out, and she'd just drive me.It didn't sound like it had anything to do with my car, and it was still on track, still on track.I remember that my friends would get along.But they weren't going to be here for the rest of our days.And I didn't know about everything.So when I was getting my first call from a friend, she said, "This is what a car is."...
48|I was sitting in the back of a big conference room where I was sitting and this guy, and he said, "What about the guy who said that this was a great idea, what did you think a lot of people thought about?" And I said, "Oh, what about it?" And he said, "Well, I'm not ready to do it yet." And I said, "Well, you know, I know the people who really got involved in this have been great. You know, the stuff that people were talking about it was great. People's opinions have changed, and the work that's been done hasn't. I just don't want to sit here and wait. But I want to just say, what are our goals?" I don't know where those goals come from. The things that i've done have been great. Like, if I could get this thing to work, I would. But I don't think I could get to work because we're not on our own.When did you get involved with gamergate?It started when we were in san francisco. It was at the time when I was working on my book on harassment and the internet, the book that was coming out. I was trying to have a book review, but it turned into a little story, a lot of very short stories. I got a phone call and I said, "Hey, I'm writing about this, and I'm just doing my best t...
49|I first grew up with a friend who is the ceo of the largest company, and we moved to chicago just before the great recession hit. The only thing that really pushed me to move was the recession, which caused my parents to start a business that I was able to operate. It was pretty amazing to me to see people that could do that, to hear their stories about what it was, to see that they were not alone in that experience, and to have people of our size doing that. And we really started it all at the same time, and so I think that's what we've been building.It was so amazing growing up.So when we went through a tough time, what made it so special?I guess, my mom and dad are kind of like the family that we've always been, with people that we love so much. I mean, our dad was actually a part of the american legion, and he's a very loyal fan of ours, so we always felt like we had a home there. So we had a family that was so well-respected and so loved by so many people. So, when a family is so well-respected, and we're also so well-respected, how much respect we get? So, it was a big gift.And you were a part of so many different eras of service you're all part of as individuals.You know, I was, like, a marin...
50|My parents divorced when I was about 5. They had a daughter with my brother when my dad died, and my sister is now her mom. They divorced when I was 12, and we went to a church for a week before I went to bed. My mom and dad took up residence in our home. My sister and I took the only other girl my parents ever met outside church. We both came down after a long day of school, and she wasn't home that late. She was at a school that we had never even visited before when I was a little girl. There was a very early church day at 8, and it was early in the morning, around 11 o'clock. My mom told me my mom was home as early as 9 or 10. I got up around 11:30, and my dad's house was the only one he had left. My dad always called my name at this point. When I was old enough to be around my dad and his family, my dad came home to greet me, and my grandma asked if I wanted to accompany her, and I told her. I told my dad that I would be there on sunday or monday, but my mom would give me the last chance I had at that time. So I was going to get a car, and my dad took the car. He would go into the back door and the doorbell rang. He asked if I'd like a ride. I said yes. The doors opened and ...
51|i'm 23 years old and I have been doing this job since I was a kid. I was a student at george washington university, but I was never really a fan of that kind of work. One day I got my degree and after that I went to university. I went to high school and I started doing this job. I worked for a university that was one of the largest colleges in the country called the university of chicago. It was an amazing opportunity because at that time it was all public policy and I was a student there because I was doing research. So that's how I ended up with my degree.And from that, I kind of got to be a very successful one. The job description went like this: I was a senior at nyu and I was working with two different graduate students that I interviewed, and I got into a relationship with one of the professors and she turned me down. I went on another interview, and then an internship. They told me that they would be coming back. And I took this job as well.The whole thing is really really cool. I think I did a couple of video interviews, and what's interesting is, I got a letter from one of my colleagues saying that I would be a great candidate for that job because I like that kind of hard, open-ended, and collaborative work. And when I had that letter back, I got to study at northwestern. And I went home and worked...
52|i've been teaching at the new school in camden, n.J., for 23 years. It's the most beautiful little school in new jersey. But there is something that disturbs me when I see it, and what the other kids there are really like.When I was in college, I got to spend three hours a day on that kind of schedule. I was a student at our first school. We were like a couple of short units on a single block. It was one block and a half. I had to work for two half-ways at 6:30.But I was so happy when we got to camden.They told me that we could spend the night there. I said: 'are you kidding?'They said to come visit us. I had to get in my car so I could make sure everyone was okay. I didn't even know that there was a bus. I said: 'are you kidding?' But they came and met us. And then we told the school we needed to get in the car and drive around one block to get to school.We walked around the block. They took a picture of me. We went around it until we were nearly ten feet high. When we got there, we said we felt great. We were like, 'whoa!' I was very disappointed. Then they said: 'did you know that you can be a student at this school?...
53|You know, it started with me walking into the store. It's because of your shopping experience, right?""Yeah.""It's been a while since then. When I walked into the store, I did a little bit of shopping thinking about what I could expect to see from the store. I didn't see any of the things that were mentioned here, like a wide-open lot, or the fact that there's a giant flower in the middle of the mall. But I just thought… this is really nice." You can tell she loves talking to you about things."I'm glad I came home to tell you my story. If you've gotten a chance in the past few days, you've definitely noticed." She says gently."Awww. I mean i've been busy. I came home from doing a game for school on sunday and came home to find out that the game I play is a bit different, and that there's no "Y'all get in here first…" That's right. You get in here first. No, I want you to have a good time out there. And you need to give me a chance…""Oh." You can tell she's been kind of worried that I'm getting too scared."You're right, i've been worried for a while now. But, if I had to guess, I'd say this is the first time i've ever bee...
54|I've been here a long time. I remember this room. A boy, who was a good kid. I was just one of those kids; I remember going up there and I saw him. I just remember my face when I came in. And then that boy walked up to me that way and he said, "What do you think I should do about it?" And I said, "What is wrong with that boy?" And he said, "He was talking to you when you were a kid, and that's what he wanted to learn." And that's what I told him. I made a big deal out of that. And I told him he could read. And that's what it was. So when I heard that the man was doing this to make this room better and better, I said, "Why don't you make it so he can read and understand what I'm saying."It was a great deal of fun. I was really excited by that. I never actually was in the room with him that night. But I think we went into it having fun because we know what he's going to do and we're going to be really excited about the job he's going to do with it. I mean, it's so different. It's fun. It's like playing a game. You're just trying to learn something to make it better. And like he was doing, he's been going back and forth and trying to learn more. Yo...
55|I think the way this first book made it to the page, it made it to the point where it would have been a lot of money or better to have written about it, and that was good enough. And I think i've done a better job writing about the way this whole thing is played out because i've got more experience with it and what this is going to be. It's not being told the truth. It's being told who the player is and how he is doing when he's in the game. It is that very question. It is not being told that you are going to win or lose. And if you win, you win. It's being told that you have a life story that you're going to tell. And this is what that game has taught me, to be able to play with that kind of game, the way that you can move, how you can hold your breath. It's a huge role in my life being a big part of what makes me tick.You see, it started with the game just after I left college. What has that taught you the most about gaming right now?Yeah, i've been looking at it from that perspective. I think if you look at the world that I run, there are a lot of different ways to spend time. There are people who can play it. I'm doing a book called the gaming man, where I'm talking about some people that I met when I left colleg...
56|i was in the middle of dinner with a great many friends who were trying to make a decent meal. We were both watching a film and we were trying to find a way to make it sound like an italian restaurant.Then I heard my friend's father say, "I want to go for a walk with my daughter."Well, I knew I was going to walk around, but not with him.Well, he went out for a walk with my daughter, and he says: "Well, I'm going for a walk with you."And then there was two guys coming up the stairs to her house. I said: "Excuse me, I'm going with my daughter, but you can't be the guy who walks with your daughter." And said, "No, if you want to come, you can come here."And the next day my daughter was playing with my daughter at the play. She was really enjoying the play.And when she asked, "What are you doing here?" I told her, "I'm playing on my computer. I'm doing all kinds of stuff." And she said, "Oh, my god, that's wonderful....
57|And here's an example. Just over a week ago, I got an email from my boss asking me if I was going to be a co-founder with the boston globe, and I said, 'yeah.' They said, 'well, here's where we stand.' The same thing happens at google here, where I get the idea for the globe. I don't know. I don't know exactly what kind of organization they're looking for. I don't know anything about them. One of my clients in singapore, is the ceo of linkedin. He's an australian born and raised in japan. He lives in singapore. I didn't know anything about him, but after that I just kind of put him on linkedin, and I went out and took a couple of meetings with them and they said, 'look, this is the right place for me to be.'Amy goodman: I understand that your boss is a japanese born and raised in japan.David lee: yeah. Well, just the fact that when you first started this, I guess my mom came from that country. Then when I moved there, my dad moved there. And so at one point he started going to work at google. And what was the impetus for your move to google? Because you came from a country that was basically more japanese than americans, so you're japanese and you've been working at google for a couple of years, and you started looking for an organization that woul...
58|I lived in a poor, rural township of breslau. The poor, the poor, were dying. The poor, the poor, were dying because the government gave them no money, the government gave them land, and they died when they lived. They got sick and died. The poor man, the poor man got sick and died, and we got sick and died. We had many women in our school who, when they worked for money, went to the government to get help for their sick, die. And then all the time when they didn't get help, they got sick, and died, and everybody hated them. It was the government, the government, that gave us the money and the government gave us the land and the government gave us the money and the government gave us the land, and everybody hated them. Nobody cared about them.The poor died as a result of this thing, and we don't care about the government.Q: it seems that the poor are dying because there are not enough money in the country.A: you have to understand. We live in a very poor country. The poor were dying because there were not enough money, there were not enough people. They were dying because government was giving them money, the government gave them land and the government gave them land, and the government gave them money. They are dying because it is really so unfair and unfair. The poor, the poor, the poor...
59|A group of my friends have given me money and some of them were nice women who were not shy. As a result, I was able to pay them over $1,000. And one of the guys said, "No, I got that because I'm a good girl." No one could possibly see a way to make me go up to $10,000 in one month. I went to a restaurant and was told, "You have to do this."My father had a great attitude, his heart was kind. He was very protective of me. He said, "What do I do? I'm a beautiful, hard-working man, I have to do this for my children." He was very strong-willed and that was his way of telling me to do it. I was very lucky. But I'm also a very smart young man.We had a really nice time on our wedding day, the family was nice. This was my best-ever wedding. They put me through a lot of hard work and they had me happy-go-lucky. One of the guys was a great mom. She would always be there with me, and she was really nice. She was a great teacher and a good neighbor. I mean, that was a happy-go-lucky thing to do. We had a lot of fun together and was all, "We love you!"I don't want to talk about my experience bu...
60|A couple of years ago I had a friend who was studying art and came up with the idea for a new painting called the "Rope of the world" That would transform how he saw it, and he's been doing it ever since! It's called the "Escape from the tomb of the unknown soldier." Well, it's not an actual zombie apocalypse. It's just a way to go home and take some extra rest and get back to normal life, get some exercise, and hopefully get something nice to eat. And I think a lot of people who can afford it, like me, think it's pretty cool. And I think there's one more thing, there's two other things, there's a million other people who can afford it, and they're all pretty passionate about it. And I think we all have to put some thought into it. And a group of us decided at some point to make that happen. To be on the set of the film in the middle of the summer, a bunch of us were down there with a lot of people watching the movie, and we just kind of came up with something that was just really cool. And we'd put a little bit of thought into it, and it was just like, "Great! Look at this!" And then we started talking about it."Oh, here we are now, two weeks before the film's scheduled to go out. We've been shooting. There's so much to d...
61|I was trying to get my wife to take me to the hospital and help with my leg and I had my hands full and a lot of stuff. She came over and I got dressed and we went into our room and she turned the tv on and said, "Hi, your name is david, and I have a story for you. When you come out of surgery, what are you going to do for me?" She gave me a big hug and told us we could have surgery.We were all kind of nervous or worried because she knew I had to go and come back to me and that it was just not possible for me so we had to come back and help. So, I was like, "My god, we got to get this done."It was really tough. Everyone was really scared, but it was really fun to do the surgery and to be able to take a picture with my wife and get that help and I'm a professional and I'm a professional mother.So, I got my job, but I didn't have the money and I didn't know where to go. I just kind of went for it. We were like family and we went to different hospitals around the united states and then it just kind of fell around here and we're like, "Where is your money." So, I was like, "I've got money." I was like, "I have money."So then it kind of fell apar...
62|it's been a while since i've been able to make a list of how many characters and monsters that were created under the original dragon ball, but I decided to keep track of it for this post. The first thing we learned is that this is the only game that was ever made with dragon ball. It wasn't quite the sequel, but it was definitely the original one."The first game that you have to consider to make this game is dragon ball, and now it's only three years later. If it didn't exist the way it is now, they wouldn't be making this one."So even though dragon ball was produced on a shoestring budget, there were a few issues with dragon ball being in production for so long. For one thing, the initial idea was that each character would be a unique, but not very well balanced, monster. Even with goku, vegeta, and super saiyan 2, vegeta was not strong enough to compete with other monsters, and was therefore weaker than goku. For this reason, as soon as we first saw goku, super saiyan 2, and frieza, we knew there would be a problem with characters that fit that template, which was why the dragon ball producers made the sequel.Because of this, the dragon ball fans had a great time in this release, even though they were not ready to get into that kind of detail. So how did they keep the amount of characters that were created up to thi...
63|Back in my own life I was an undergraduate student. I was on campus at the university of california system. My teacher, dr. Lillian h. Johnson, had been teaching me some of these things back then. You could come to your classes and there were people in our class, like dr. Lawrence j. Anderson, who was a professor of electrical engineering at uc davis, and you could take a course on electromagnetism and he would have something to say, 'i do see some other uses for this stuff.' What I would say is 'i don't see that you don't have to say that.' For instance, you could do experiments with this stuff. That was the first time I had ever seen it happen, for the first time. I was shocked and I felt so embarrassed that I didn't have the courage to say that.So in a way, because you couldn't talk about this stuff, it was a challenge. It was hard for me not to. I felt like I had no choice. I started to think, 'you know, if someone's thinking about these things they probably don't have the right motivation to do it.' So I started reading about it and I started to think, 'this kind of is, by nature, very hard to do. What we want to do is try something different here, and then we'll make a big leap and we'll be able to do something very different as well.' [laughs....
64|When I went to work for the justice department in the early 1990s, we got sued by a man who said he was a former fbi agent in new york city. So his name was steve dorman. I remember him being the one who asked me if I was going to work with the justice department on the case of paul joseph watson, the former soviet nuclear physicist who was murdered in a russian prison, and I said no, because it was an important one. We were going to have a big trial, and we had no witnesses. And the judge in my office was in prison. We won, and then after six months, he said, "Well, that's a nice story. But I was not willing to work for you, because we know the government wanted to have this case dragged out, and I would like to move forward." So we started a legal fight, but we eventually got sued by a former fbi agent, richard smith, who was a friend of my father's and went out on one of the most difficult, hard years of my life. And he tried out for the government, and he took a job at the justice department, which then turned out to be the department of homeland security, but they hired a lawyer who was a former fbi agent, and he hired me to be an assistant u.S. Attorney, which is what I did for about fifteen years before this was changed. So I worked very hard. I was very good at getting things goin...

66|I was driving to my house to go on vacation but I saw a young woman driving by and I asked her whether she could get out of there and she said no. I left when she asked me to drive her car up into the driveway and we went across the street. I was sitting in the middle of the street and there was a woman in her car, she was in the driver's seat of my car. I looked and I see this little black haired teen sitting in my car and I saw a man with a black dress walking up to her and his hair was pulled back in a ponytail. He was about 50 years old, he was wearing a red dress and the woman behind him was wearing his hat right now. He was holding a gun and he opened his mouth and said "I don't belong in here." I was in disbelief, I thought I was going to explode but I could smell a gun in the air from behind me. The bullet that's in his mouth came out from his mouth. I looked at the bullet and it went out of his head, I didn't know how long it took to hit him but I couldn't do anything about it. I thought it might be the man. The man I was sitting with was standing under him, he was walking through the alleyway and I can't find him. I grabbed the pistol and ran to the corner door. This man was standing right in front of me. I grabbed the gun and my frien...
67|It started out as a joke. It turned into an article—something that I'm proud to write here.We all remember the famous joke from our friends at the daily beast…it never occurred to us until I started writing about it.I was writing about an unusual little idea. But, what I realized was, this is the real story: how this happened, and it's all good. It ended up as part of a whole, all of us. I'm proud.It doesn't matter what anybody expects. We're not talking of a movie, or a comedy, or a play that is about to be played, or an issue that is, not just about the topic of the story, or maybe just about politics. We're talking of something very special, and that's this.You're the author of this article that's been making you look silly for years. I'm also the first author of a book, a memoir….This book is about that book.I'm not writing it to have an article, or any sort of a memoir, but to be able to give some voice to the story. In this instance, I am talking about a new book on the subject, and this is about a book that we wrote a couple of years ago. It was all about some interesting idea. I'm very honored to be writing it.I know we did, but we really liked it, just because i...

69|When I was a kid, it was all over the place, so I decided to do a little homework. I had done some small assignments to help them understand what I was doing, but then it just became an issue. So I really got into making them better at making decisions, rather than just getting them in the wrong place....
70|i had an interesting conversation with my sister about the importance of the book.She asked if I had read it. She looked up "Wizard", and said "The secret war", and then I read "It's a good book, don't you think?"I didn't understand. I didn't want to read "It". "It's a good book, don't you think?" I had to learn it from my parents.There were so many lessons learned, and there were so many important lessons learned on the pages, and the pages were very good.You might think, "Oh, they're all too good. We're still learning, and everything is very different." I would have a very bad feeling.So, after spending a few more hours reading, I decided to write a summary of the book.I got this response from my sister.She said, "Don't think that we're writing a book about magic, you know, but it's worth it." She told me to keep playing with the same rules, as she always does, but she wants this piece to be as unique as possible."We're still learning, and nothing is as special as what we did 10 years ago. I hope you understand."The story of how this book came to be is a story from a different era. A very different time.My parents used to sa...
71|I was with your dad and my grandmother in the backseat of the car going on a night out. In my car that night my grandfather called me the first time out of the blue and told me to check his records. I came out of the car, was a little disappointed. He was just like, 'what are you doing in my car now? Why are you here?' He was like, 'are you here to get your car? What are you going to do?' And I was like, 'i think he's trying to steal my car because my grandmother is so scared of her boyfriend that she's not going to let him drive home!' But he kept on doing it throughout the evening. I was like, 'i didn't think this would happen with a guy like that.' So I don't know why I didn't tell him about it. But to be honest, I'd love to hear from him. So I was like, it's just an amazing thing that he is doing.""But it was a really hard thing to go through with that. He would always call. He would say, 'come in.' He'd come in to see my grandfather's house. He'd come in and they'd say, 'we've been playing here for some six months, you've come home to your mother and kids, and I just want you to stay and see my grandfather,' and I would go up to the windo...
72|We were walking down a sidewalk at about 9 at night in the early morning, our car was totally blown up. We stopped in front of the house to wait for the ambulance service to take us to work. I remember being just a little out of breath, I could barely breathe. I couldn't see anything. We saw a police car, and we ran. We got to the back of the vehicle. We got to the front of the vehicle and just kept moving. I remember sitting there in my chair, breathing very hard, not knowing what to do. It was a little shock, but I can't describe it. All of a sudden I went from full awake, to almost full awake, and there were screams, and I felt like I was going to die. I couldn't see. I was lying in my bed, it really was like a miracle. I don't know who pulled my arms out, but they would have picked my leg out, and I might not have been alive. The ambulance pulled out of the house. And I still remember the police car trying to get up the block just so we wouldn't have to leave the neighborhood. And then they picked up a child. And I'm just not sure. But I'm sure it was the same boy that was seen on the video. He was seen running towards me, and we just got on the car. And it was like he was running. I saw him run down the street, but he's stil...
73|when I was a kid, my dad ran into me on the street, and he went, "Oh, I'm a kid, you're going to be a really proud black man, you're going to win the lottery." And I did, and the kids did the rest. And they were such proud because they weren't going to be discriminated against. We were very proud.There's a couple of things that the media don't know about you. We were born in the segregated south. But what do you make of this? You said you were white and now you're african-american. Do you feel like you can relate to your experience in the country? What do you think about this?I want to understand that it's not that I feel like I'm white. I wanted to be a kid, because I really wanted to be a kid. If that were true, I would have done what I did. I would have gotten over my depression, because I remember my mom, who was a teacher, and she was like, "I'm gonna take you back to what you were, and let you do what you want to do, and make sure you have the best body possible, with proper hair, with decent clothes, and a good body for yourself."My parents are black. They're very proud for that. They're very proud, and I think that is something that we can all relate to. But I have ...
74|I was on a trip to the caribbean and I saw a guy in the middle. The guy turned around and said 'come on, let's see you in black. You look like a man.' He was a friend of mine who also has a lot of black hair, and he said 'what do you want?'" She went on to say that the guy then pointed to a girl, who was sitting in a chair with her face covered by her pants, and called a taxi driver and said 'he'll get you a cab. I will ask you to take me over in the cab.'"This case should not be limited to black people. What we would see from this case is how police can use all of their powers, including the power to force a person to wear their clothes in public, to silence a person for being a white, male, transgender person, or to force someone else to dress like him in public.In this way, the white criminal is able to use all of his power to silence a person who is less vulnerable than he is. A person who would have a lot less power could be subjected to more violence and abuse. If black lives, people will be subjected to more violence and abuse and less trust over their lives.So what is the right answer to this problem?The answer to white crimes is to recognize this problem will take time to be solved and to use the powers entrusted by our laws to prevent violence and abuse...
75|When I was a kid in high school, I didn't know that there was a place for women in the movie industry in new york. That was just a weird place," She says."I don't remember the day, but for the first time in my life I was in a movie theater. I just didn't know what to do with it.""The first time I went to movie theaters, my mom always insisted that I be dressed, that I do something special, but I was never told what to do," She continued. "When I was a kid, I just thought 'mom, I want my kids to become famous.' I was pretty obsessed with this stuff, but when I was a little girl, I went off to a little dance club to get some girls.""My mom said, 'you're supposed to have a special time with your kids to have a good time, you're not supposed to do anything in front of your kids,' and that's exactly what I did. I had a lot of fun with the movies. It's not a lot. And so for my kids, at least I thought, 'well, I can do something really special to have a good time with my kids.'

76|This was our first time to get this, because the first time was at a hotel on the other side, in the back of a hotel called the hotel de la riviere. We met the owner of the hotel. He had a very cool way of speaking—i'm sorry, a sort of english english. He looked to me very much like I was a native speaker of chinese. And he made me write. I said, "You know how I think you're going to write your first book, and to think I'd write an english novel?" And he got on with it all and started calling me, "Jack, jack, jack."Then it hit the point where it was a dream come true."It was the first day of my life where I was having a dream like this."—jack, the first day of my life where I was having a dream like this. It was my first time writing.In the spring of 1972, a friend called to say that it was time to have another dream. It is an honor to be interviewed. Jack had never been to the dream. He was only fifteen, he was a little high, and he was twenty-five. He was always a writer, but I saw, from the cover of the book, from a woman who had asked me what kind of a dream he was having, that he was at the same moment when he was experiencing a dream. H...
77|It is the story of the first night of prayer.This is the evening that has been my favorite for over a year. The feeling of the day was exhilarating because, as I started to get stronger, I really had my hands tied behind my back.That is when I felt the first real weight of fear, realizing that I knew I was not going to be ok…i had already been given a full body view.I was terrified that if my hand touched my body, I would fall over. That, no matter how many times I touched it, I would fall over. It struck me, at that point, that my body is not ready to let me down.I did not want to lose my hand. I wanted to be able to control my weight.I felt that while my hands were touching my body, my muscles and my skin were not.In a desperate attempt to get my body strong, my body could not make contact with my hands.I knew I was going to hurt myself. However, by the time I was about to fall, I was no longer sure what to do. For whatever reason the anxiety began to build. I felt like I was going to die, that my body was not ready to let me go.By the time I was about to fall, I knew that I was going to have to do the same. I knew that my body was not ready t...
78|we were in our office, we had our phone call, we were talking about the car, about the bus and the plane, he's driving it.I was talking to myself about that. A couple days later, we had to buy a plane for this job. We needed a car because someone was going to buy a plane in a month.So we were looking for a car, and we had to buy a plane in one month.And that's how we got that job.I thought, why am I not going to sell my house?And I went to the garage and I said, "Oh my gosh. Why, why doesn't this happen to me?"And I said, "But then I am going to see my parents and I am going to see my father someday. I can have your permission to have that car."So I said, "Well, I guess that makes sense. I'm going to get the lease. And I will be able to pay my car back. My father will be able to pay for it. My father will still be a good dad."And my father did. And he said, "Thank you."And it was like, "That's all right. You're going to pay for it." And I thought, well, that's how hard it would be.We had to pay my car. He said...
79|I met a guy who was in a club called jocks. He had a nice club in his room. He was a big man with a big body, like a golf buddy. I said, "Okay, let's move out of here to be with you." "Okay, let's move to the club." He told us that he had a girlfriend named jill. He called me and asked me to see the girl. I went to her apartment and I told the girl, "You need some help. I'm an older guy. Do you know where I can get some help?" I said, "I know where." "Okay, if I can help you, what would you like to do for me?" She said, "I like to be with you." He said, "I want to be with you two." I said, "You can get me some new clothes and a car and I'lllet you drive me to the club." He said, "You want to join my team? I can get you that. Go to the club and go play football for a week and then you can go to your team and be with me." He said, "We're the one in the club, so I'llget you my old car and the rest can be yours. I can help you." "I really need that. I'm not getting any help from you or anything like that," She said. He said, "I'm a little disappointed. It'...
80|My wife just saw her daughter walking out of the house and said, 'well, I'm in a coma.' And the next thing you know, I'm in the hospital, I'm in cardiac arrest, and I'm not in bed. My daughter was like, 'no, no, no,' and I said, 'oh my god, there's someone there. Can I tell you how I fell asleep?' She came in and said, 'i didn't even know I can't sleep,' and the next thing you know, she's in cardiac arrest, and she's just like, 'i can't take my daughter to the hospital, because she's in a coma.' And I said, 'well, wait. You'll understand.' So she got so concerned about me and said, 'i got to the hospital because I know I can't take my daughter to the hospital.' And she said, 'that's your right, so that's how I said, so you can take my daughter to the hospital.' And I said, 'yeah.'And then you know, we are in a place where we have a hospital at which I can't take my daughter to the hospital. And I'm like, 'oh my god, there's someone there and I'm in cardiac arrest. Can I help?' And she said, 'oh my god, there's someone there in the hospital who's dying,' and you know, I'm like, 'how can ...
81|In the late 1990s, the world turned against the taliban. There were dozens of massacres that started in the late 1990s and 2000s in several countries, including in afghanistan where we now have the taliban. The number of victims were many times more than the number of victims during the cold war, and yet the taliban are still murdering people in afghanistan today and not taking any major action against them. The taliban have also lost a number of lives and are in the process of going bankrupt. The taliban are still trying to seize power.Amy goodman: let me talk about afghanistan, in this moment, in february of 2011, the first meeting of the nato coalition that took place in afghanistan. This is a very important day for american people. We're here in the studio, so let's go back to our conversation about the importance of afghanistan. We'll just say this.Sen. Catherine graham: it was a big day for us at this time because we had a meeting held in chicago with our members, with many more. And we had a group of people who were very disappointed, the afghans. One of them is mr. John kerry, who is the president of the united states, who is in afghanistan after he made some of these important moves against the taliban. And the question for mr. Kerry is, how can we move him back a little bit and not lose all credibility with the afghan people? And we have to make certain that w...
82|There is nothing for a person to complain of about you."I've been watching this on my phone for four days now. I'm still wondering if I could talk to you about this? There is no way in hell I wouldn't have to. I'd say that I'm a better person when I'm in control. And I'm not just a bad person right now. And I'm a lot less stressed than I was a year ago.What really makes you so happy is that you don't think about any of this. I didn't know that you could have changed the course of your life any way you like, except by going public. You were just doing what was right. You wanted to be the best you could be, that was it. And you didn't want to go off the rails, that you don't want to repeat that.I know that you said, "My husband is dying so I don't want to move to a different area." It was true, but I still haven't gotten over that. I'm so proud of you. And you feel really proud of that.You have to say something. I was a child. I know what I did. I know my responsibilities as a mother were right up my alley. And I want to express to this lady that that was going on here, that that was her role, that she's a person that has to take responsibility for what her family is doing...
83|this morning, during the first part of our two-part series, we talked about two different things. First, our discussion about our own experience with the "Diversity" In our community. We also talked about the fact that our community is not yet ready for what I want to say.Second, what I learned from my first interview.It is not easy to talk about people who are a diverse body of knowledge. We just have to be real friends with ourselves, not just a bunch of white dudes.I've been in the community long enough to know some of the people who are a bit less like me. A lot of the people i've met are people who are mostly straight. As with the gay community, the black community, the hispanic community, they are more like me than other straight people who are straight.We talk about how people from different parts of the planet do not like each other. We talk about how different cultures differ, how different cultures are built with different methods of worship.We talk about how people from different places in the world do not like each other. Even though we have different accents and we are not the same people.When you think of people who are "Diversity," You get a sense of how much it is hard for them to see themselves when they are not "Diverse." People of color, even in the same country, are different.The reason peopl...
84|I came to the united states with the intention of getting married. In fact, after a few months I found out that it had become my mission to marry people who wanted to get married, but in fact, because of their religion, were not allowed to. Because I was a muslim, that was the hardest part, because it led to the realization that I couldn't become married. I said to myself, "You know, you can't make me a muslim. It just shows you are going to be the same as me." I had to go back to england and come back, and I'm happy I stayed in england, but that is so much easier than being a muslim, a muslim in america. And, finally, at the age of 16, my family was from the country of origin. I was in ireland, and I was really excited about going to school. I was really into ballet, and I was very excited about the role as a ballet teacher, and so, I went to school in manchester and I went to school on the train. I started doing that in london, london, and I went to the same ballet school as my father. So I was really excited. And it was so easy. I could come home to this beautiful land, and then I would just go there with my mother, take my kids to that house, make sure that they were going to be good people, and be happy there. And when my parents got my brother and sister...
85|You see, a long time ago we were at this very place.We were sitting in a very small room.And the man I was sitting next to had just walked in.Then they came in and said,"We can't take care of ourselves if you let us drive around in a van."And I said,"Well, don't worry about that either, it could get very lonely."But it was a perfect storm and I didn't stop.My heart wasn't in it at all at the time.It was just right.We sat there, very quietly.It was this wonderful time when someone was driving me to my office.They were taking pictures with us and saying,"Okay, we're going to take photos with you, if things were to really get out of control.But we're not going to let them drive us around in a van."And they looked at me with great admiration and I decided"You're amazing."Well, for the record.We were never alone as such.They were just like.A whole new level of joy....
86|I'm trying to be the kid I want to be. You know what my dad told me? 'When I'm ready to cry, I'lldo it.' When I'm ready to cry, I'm always happy. You know what? I've been crying for three days now. I'm ready! When I'm ready for this, I'lldo my job! If I don't have it, it happens! You know what it means? I've been through so much. It's been such a long time. Oh, oh, thank you! It's been so long! I love you so much! Thank you so, so much! Thank you so, so much! Thank you so, so much! Thank you so, so much. I'm so glad. Thank you so much!She then added, "I'm always happy to be there for kids.""I mean, if I had to choose between being proud of my kid and being like 'hey, I'm so excited to be happy and ready and be the kid I want to be,' I choose the latter. My kid wouldn't have to live with an endless supply of plastic surgery scars to keep his eyes bright enough to look past the light. That stuff happens to me all the time. And I didn't choose to be happy, or to be happy for anyone; I chose to be happy because of the little things, all the time. And so it's been like tha...
87|It was a year ago, when I was just starting my sophomore year at a college in washington, d.C., when I was out and about alone. I had only a dozen friends and only one of them was my sister, whom I'd met at a bar in philadelphia. And I was so much more comfortable in the place, than I had ever been or even felt before.And I was looking for a place to live.I'd been living in the same dormitories for a decade, and I'd become obsessed with the idea of living alone. In my early 20s, I had moved in with a college roommate, who was living a pretty unremarkable life. He was also a professional soccer player and the best friend I'd ever had. We all wore our shirts on the walls; I couldn't keep a close eye on him because he didn't look my way.He asked if I had any money, so I went to one of the student lounges, which you might expect to be empty for an unsupervised dorm. It was pretty cool, but I was in one of the most desolate of dorms. The only thing that kept me occupied was the walls that were so thick, so hard they hurtle around the corner, and I couldn't even see anything from my windows. Then, at the end of the long hallway, I saw a red line. I tried to see it—it wa...
88|Some years ago, I lost my father in battle. What do you remember about that? I remember how he put his hands on a soldier's shoulder before he died. And then he would take two small children. And one of them would start singing like he was going to die. So I said, 'just remember, how lucky he was, how lucky he was that we could have him, because he would have loved us so much, that he'd come home so strong, with so many wonderful people in his life to keep it alive.' "It's been almost two years since, and i've still not been told about the incident of his last-minute escape from his parents, or about his last-minute escape from the army. My first report (after learning about it a long time ago) was that I had forgotten he was at a hospital. I told my staff that, in his last few months, I'd been in the military, and he'd been out on an overseas deployment. When I came back to him after two months, he was still in intensive care as his parents took him to a local hospital. When I asked him to come over, he told me that, since his parents had lost their son, he'd been in "War zones".I told him that when he returned home, he'd be wearing his purple heart, and the blood he'd shed when he broke out of vietnam would be on a silver platter. H...
89|A young boy was playing in a playground at the time of a shooting on the corner of 15th and seventh street in the west village. He was walking along the sidewalk, and suddenly there was an explosion. On the corner below the blast, a young boy got out of the car, took off his coat, walked to the curb, walked through the crowd and shot into the crowd and then shot himself in the head. The young boy was still alive and was taken to the hospital, then to the hospital after several hours. The doctor said that he did think that the man shot at him was a mentally unstable man.""So you thought you weren't safe during the fight, but it's like a bomb goes off, someone dies and then you die and you're gone and you have to go back to jail."The nypd's response to the shooting, which the new york daily news reports is part of a massive investigation into the police department's response to the sept. 11 attacks, was to investigate whether a number of people had been involved in the attack, including four police officers who were injured as they were fighting in syria. The news outlet also reported that two officers were arrested following the incident.In the last week, the nypd has seen increased numbers of calls from the public about the nypd's response to the attacks. The nypd reportedly received more than 7,000 calls in the first 24 hours of the attacks, which was the highest total from any da...
90|There is one small thing about this book that you need to have in mind. It's about the lives of the four americans who were killed by islamic state fighters and their families, and it's about the struggles of those lost to this barbarous regime. It's about those of us who are struggling. For now, as you write this, we're hearing the words of the islamic state—and they are still talking about it, because their own story doesn't match.There was a great deal of concern for the american people when the book was first published. It was called "The new caliphate," And a lot of people thought it was the first truly islamic book that had, to my knowledge, been published by the publisher. You could not have more than a few thousand dollars spent on a manuscript. But the fact that you came up with that sort of piece of propaganda on the cover of the book, we felt it was worth it for the fact that our government had come down on us for this act of terrorist violence. And, in fact, that book was called "The new caliphate: the origins of the islamic state." I think that we'll be getting there.Amy goodman: we go into more detail about the book. I wanted to thank you so much for being with us...
91|I'm trying to give you a chance to tell the people to tell you who you really are. That I can't stop until those people give them the chance to tell the truth about your own journey. Because that's what life is all about, and the chance to tell all this truth.So, all these people have been through so much, what makes them different? We're the ones that just started making the decisions and we've learned so much, but we're the ones who just want to take your money and send it to your dreams. We're the ones that just want to be part of the magic. I don't think they get it. Sometimes people just don't know what they're doing.Now, the second day we see you, it's not like you saw anybody yet. No, you saw us, and it was the first day we showed up. It was the first day that we came out of the shadows. People are saying your real name, and your real life, and you are talking about your life right now and that's something you're going to get to, that's something that your friends will tell you. But you'll be asking them and telling them, what are you doing? I don't know what is on my mind, but I'm here. I'm not going to deny it. I'm not going to deny that you are here, and I'm going to tell you that you're here because I kno...

93|when I was 16, my parents came over to my house and I was on the road for a month with no rest until I broke up with my mother and moved to new york city.At the time, it was a big deal. I was living in san francisco and going through a divorce, and then this year, I decided I wanted to do something really special.I had a house in new jersey with my brother's name. I wanted to be a writer. We wanted to be a novelist. So my mom took me to a bookstore and gave me a new book.She said, "How did you make that novel?"I had to put out my writing because so many people liked it. It was pretty hard. But I wanted to write about the human condition, what's happening, why is it there, what's happening. So I said, "I can't make this work because my family is sick." And she said, "You make it, you make it good. No one will like this. Nobody will write you better."My friend, who was a novelist at the time, said, "I thought to myself, 'how does it feel to be gay?' There's a saying that says, 'do a better job.'"My mom said, "Why is your life better than mine?'"Because every piece of advice I would give her about a new book, I would sa...
94|what I told him when I got him: I don't think you were that stupid. I told him I was going to the store in the morning and he went, "Get the damn thing out of here."That's why I wanted him to bring it. I didn't want him to be in a car without a license plate number that I picked up in the parking lot. I didn't want him to be sitting down in a police station with the keys.And as far as the people who got me, they don't feel like they've done anything wrong. They're just angry.They're frustrated. They're angry that I'm not doing more to help that young lady out.I'm not saying I don't do my job. But, you know, I'm not going to do my job any longer because of this.I'm not going on in public with you any longer when I'm talking about my family, or with your parents, or your friends.I just think you should be ashamed of yourself when you tell a bunch of angry people your life is going to be different.When I was in junior high, my mom had one of my friends drive over to see me. She wasn't really around, but I saw something. She looked like she was thinking, "I don't know what to say about that guy. He's such a terrible person!"And sh...
95|I'm a teenager, right? And I used to play basketball and play baseball. And i'm, like, 40, 40. A lot of times, I think my dad's getting in the way, and i've played baseball before, but I just have these questions, like, why can't I play in baseball? Why can't I play college football?You know, I'llsay that. I'm 27. And I'm watching the simpsons right now. And I just started thinking, "Oh, i've never seen a show like this. I don't know how it ended. It feels like a fairy tale." Then, it became a little bit out of control. And I wanted to try and make this new show not have a fairy tale, a whole lot of fairy tales, but at the same time, a real fairy tale. And I thought, "Oh yeah, it's time to play an nba. I don't know who's gonna be going to the lakers. I don't know who they wanna be."So I was like, "Okay, well, this is one of those things where we're all going to love it, and we're all going to want to try to tell it. We're all going to be in this world together, we're all going to want to play basketball, we're all gonna want to be in this world together. We are going to try and figure it out. But there's somethin...
96|That was the last time I saw her. I was going to give her a birthday present but I was afraid that if you did it before I would be afraid. I saw her smile. I just couldn't stand it. She was very attractive, a young blonde, short, with a nice face. And she looked nice. I did not like her for that very long. I was going to kill her, I just couldn't get anything going.It was not until the end of the semester that I got really sick. We had taken the bus. I went home, and I was sitting there. I didn't know if I was going to die, because I had been there my whole life and my life was filled with this fear that just never happened to me. We had come out there and were sitting in the parking lot of the gym, and I had a heart attack at the end of the semester, and I said, "I need to give you something. I need to show you something. I need to show you that I'm not a coward." I was sick with a virus.So I went to the doctor immediately to get my life back. After five months I had this thing called the 'grave virus'. So I went back home and wrote all the records, and made a movie, and then I went to the emergency room four times a month and died.I had a great life. But it's what it is...
97|I was sitting at a small table next to a table of friends and I noticed we had eaten dinner. I looked out the window and I couldn't make out the names of the people that were at that table. I looked back and saw some of them sitting around the table with their hands and they were still staring at my window. That's when I started to look. I didn't look at them. I saw them with their hands. And I looked at their faces and I saw who they were, what they were like. They looked like I had never seen or seen before. My eyes were locked on them and they stared at me and then I looked out the window and they were still staring at my window.That night I took a deep breath and I took another deep breath. I did not know what to do. What to do.At this point in the conversation I knew she was saying something about how she wanted someone to come and watch you with her. I wasn't alone. I remember thinking how strange it must be, she was sitting next to me and she was looking at me like I was in some weird place or something. I remember thinking of my parents and how they had been in the same room that night. I remember thinking about the phone book and there was a note on it and it said "This is the last show I'm going to see at the frat party." I just saw it. At one point I heard this voic...
98|A friend and friend of mine was killed by a car while on a tour to india. The car sped up in our direction. They asked me, what are you doing with this car?" I said, "Oh my god, I see a white guy on the road, I know about him, but he's a black guy. I'm thinking about whether he's going to pick it up or not. He was a passenger, he's a passenger. He came in with the intention of killing us. He drove into the crowd, he killed some kids. He's a white guy and is a racist!" I said, "Well, I am racist. He's a white guy, he's a white guy, but I saw him driving into the crowd." And then I said, "You are a white guy, aren't you?" He said, "No. No. It's a black man who goes for the money. He drives in with the intention of killing us." I said, "What do I think he is driving?" And he said, "He didn't know what to do." So he was in his car, he was carrying a note. I said, "He's a white guy, he's a white guy. He drove into the lot of kids. He was on a lot of kids." I said, "Where are these kids? Where are these kids going? Where are these kids going to go?" And he walked away. The car drov...
99|one year after my divorce, I worked with my husband on an interview with nbc. It was a great job.He started asking questions and having a lot of fun, and when we started talking about it we were both so excited.All of a sudden, things really came out of the blue.I did not have this luxury.My boyfriend and I had gotten a call from our partner from a friend in chicago.I had worked for a company called one year ago , and it was a great opportunity.It paid off!We started moving, and now they have a very nice new office in new york city called ingress.I love what ingress is, and what they do here!I love the idea of building a team that makes sense to each other. And I have to admit, the best way I have to think about my life and how the world is moving out of my way is when I see my friends doing the same thing. And I get great responses!I got a job as a salesperson at a big technology, and my girlfriend had worked for one or two other companies that had done the same thing. I couldn't believe it.I think that's something to behold.The best part, at the time, was that when I was younger, it was really easy to work on projects. I just never felt like I coul...
100|i was doing my homework and going to the beach. A girl in my class was taking notes from her notebook of notes. I said, "What's going on here?" It was actually quite cool, a couple of points. But i've never seen anything like that before. She's talking about one of the things that she found that we thought had something important to tell us.Now, if I was to write you my favorite piece of writing today, I'd say the first one is "The great depression." I won't spoil that, but it's in there. The next one is "The final blow." I guess it's an interview with tom haney, who wrote "The great depression," That I thought that it was one of my favorite pieces of writing i've ever done.What's the key you had to add to your collection to make it so different?I started with an abstract sketch based on one of my drawings that I had just made at a sketch studio, about a few days after I graduated college. I didn't have anybody to use, so I spent the night in my sketch studio. I never went back to my drawing studio. I did a couple of sketches there, and I was really tired when I did it, so I went back to the drawing studio and made it for you.That was the first sketch I put on my facebook page. It was probably the first time I ever saw a...
101|I have one friend at a party of three kids. She is really beautiful. She's beautiful. Two years, she was on that show and she was getting drunk and drinking all night. And she says, "I thought he was just a nice guy. And he was a nice guy. But I thought, 'oh, he's just drunk.' " And in fact, I told her that my friends and my family were looking at me like, "Oh, he's just a nice guy. And he's just a nice guy. And he said, 'you know what? You can go back and do that.' Well, that's the way it's always been before—you can always put him on the spot. He's just a nice guy. He's just an ordinary guy. And that's all just a big lie. And I think it's all about how you think about your friends in the world, and how much they really like you. Just how you're just as good to them as they are. That's all."In the story, you said, "So you said that's why you didn't like me so much. Why you did. Why you went back and did that to a friend. What happened was that she just sort of became like a child in my family. And then it sort of became like, if she's like a child now, you're making a fool of yourself by not liking her. You're making a foo...
102|One moment I was out there doing the first round of a tournament, with a bunch of guys I knew that I should take care of, with me being the no. 1 guy. And then one night, it was five guys I knew that he should put on his best clothes, he'd go with his best friend to the show. And so I was out on stage and the guys were all laughing. We'd been on stage with our best friends. I remember talking to them, and they thought, "I'm going to go with a girl. I'm going to be the best girl in the world, and I'm gonna get the best girl in the world." So I go and they told me "We have two guys of the best friends, and we have two very good girls. Can we put them on?" So I went, "Yes," And that's how I came into the booth. I went, "What?" And they said, "We have two guys of the best friends, and we've got three good girls." So I was like, "No, I'm a girl. I'm the best." And I was like, "You're going to go. No." So I got into the booth and I was like, "That's it. I'm going to win the next game." I went, "No, I'm going get the no. 1 guy. No." So that's how I knew I could win the next round...
103|Just as my brother-in-law was going to come over in the morning and watch me sleep, I noticed when I'd just finished getting off the car, I'd get in his car."He was sitting on the hood, just staring at the sun, and I just looked down and saw it as a white sun. I wasn't sure what to do, but my brother-in-law just said, 'this is where you were.' I went over to him and I said, 'how are you doing? I told you I was going to get your brother-in-law to go to bed. He said he couldn't help it.'"He said, 'i told you I couldn't help it.' It was just an unbelievable coincidence."I said, 'how can you do this?'""He said, 'you can. I told you what to do. I told you I was going to get your brother-in-law to go to bed."I was scared.""Well, I think I know exactly how he was going to tell me to go to bed - I'm sure he was going to see me."We were about to go to bed when the lights went off. So I had to stay in my car."The next thing I know I was sitting on the hood, watching the sun rising, and I was watching my mother's ca...
104|i was in the middle of dinner with a great many friends who were trying to make a decent meal. We were both watching a film and we were trying to find a way to make it sound like an italian restaurant.Then I heard my friend's father say, "I want to go for a walk with my daughter."Well, I knew I was going to walk around, but not with him.Well, he went out for a walk with my daughter, and he says: "Well, I'm going for a walk with you."And then there was two guys coming up the stairs to her house. I said: "Excuse me, I'm going with my daughter, but you can't be the guy who walks with your daughter." And said, "No, if you want to come, you can come here."And the next day my daughter was playing with my daughter at the play. She was really enjoying the play.And when she asked, "What are you doing here?" I told her, "I'm playing on my computer. I'm doing all kinds of stuff." And she said, "Oh, my god, that's wonderful....
105|If I'm going to have breakfast with you and tell you how I feel about your life, you're going to feel great and you'll be better off if you had the opportunity to have a conversation with me and talk about it. So listen. And listen. It won't be like, "Oh, I can relate to you. You're fine."Now, this is a little bit different, but I know the word is here.If you have a situation that you want to talk about, you're going to have something to say in the beginning.So, you're going to have something to say.If you're not having a conversation, you're not going to have a conversation.In order for people to talk, they just need to have it.But it gets a lot more complicated when that moment comes.When the opportunity presents itself.Your life comes before mine.So, when that opportunity comes to pass, you're going to have to go through that.And I know you're all going to be frustrated with me.How do I do that?I've come to the realization that if I didn't have the opportunity this past week, I would definitely have been fine.Okay, so, what do I do?I'm going to show you the tool.Now, I know you'll think it's funn...
106|At the beginning I had to explain that I wouldn't be able to talk to anyone if my girlfriend kept telling me I was insane. I never really thought that my girlfriend would stop having that sort of stuff, even though I had to keep calm. When I told her I was insane and she called me "Crazy" For it, though, I knew it wasn't me. And now it's like when my whole life ended because she tried to get me to put a condom on me. I didn't want to. She's really nice enough to know all I have to say, but I didn't want her to have things happen to me.You had to deal with the whole panic that came with being "Crazy." It is very hard for me to describe how different I was from when my kids began to grow up. I can't think of a single parent who has seen this happen before.I went to see my doctor, and they said that my girlfriend and I were going to be in the er there, and that they believed me to be on "Extreme medication," And we didn't know if we could be there again. The doctors couldn't explain anything about the medication, but they told us that they were just treating us for a certain reason. So I just sat there in my room and said that I didn't have anything to deal with. I didn't even feel like talking about anything really, as if I was having to explain to them tha...
107|It's a story of a man who was in the middle east trying to find his way back home. There was a war, a war like most wars of any kind.He went to his friend's house and when I said hi and walked into his home he was stunned. There's a lot of people who go to war with isis. But they don't do it because they don't want to be in the same situation with me. So they're going to come to you and say you're not welcome in their country and you're not welcome to visit their country.You know, when he got back home his friends said he was a little bit paranoid and scared. He got back up and he said we need to work together on this mission. Because we are so close. It's a really important mission and we are. To go to their house after isis has left for syria. For isis to be coming here. And we have to work together. I'm asking you to come get me now.And the next time we talk about this kind of thing, I want to be sure that at that point in time, we're all talking about this mission.So you say: this mission is a war against iran. Tell me when will this get to iraq, where are the americans going to be.I tell you what. I don't even know which one. I know they're going to come out today, tomorrow wit...
108|A man, a young man, this great man who was a great friend of the country, of the young, young women, of the children, the woman, a young couple, a whole set of people of great value to the country. He was called by many names and names, and he was called by the greatest of all names. He was asked to marry in the land of great britain, or to marry in his fatherland, or to marry in the land of the british isles. I mean, he was asked to do what. And I say to you, that would be a big mistake. Well, now, he was asked to marry in the land of great britain. And that he did. And he married in an island, and she did, and he married in the land of great britain, and he married in the land of the french east indies. And his love for country, and his love for the young, he said to his father, that is, to the people of his country. And he went off to england and he took a lot of land in great britain and came back in time. And he wrote the book. The book tells the story of the young man, and he wrote it so many times that i've forgotten about it. The book says much about what he had to do to have his marriage done. He wrote the book, he wrote it so many times that i've forgotten about it. I mean, what the book says i...
109|When we were in college in high school, we came to new york. We had a house where we didn't have to clean it, we had two bedrooms, and we had two people. One of them was just kind of like, 'oh, my god, this is so wonderful.' They'd take her home and they'd clean it. So we had three bedrooms. It was really lovely, and the house I lived in was in manhattan. So I had a lot of children and I was living in a house, and then we built a new kind of house.But I was also really, really bad at living on a lot of different floors, a lot of different kinds of stuff. I was in the basement of an old building and I lived in three different rooms and three different things, and when I did get to those three rooms, I found a basement, a very interesting basement. I found a lot of houses where there were no more windows. And I used to find a lot of different things, some of them more interesting than others in that basement. I'd buy things I had never used yet; I'd look at them and think, 'oh yeah, that's the best house i've ever seen.' I had a lot of that and then I'd buy new things and new things and new things.It was a fascinating project. I've always kind of been a little bit sort of, I think, a somewhat unemotional perso...
110|i'm from the suburbs and I'm a member of the east texas chapter of the republican party. At the time of my election, the gop had its own group -- the fraternal order of police. And we wanted to make sure that all members felt welcome at a rally or event where they could make comments that were not, in all likelihood, supported by a majority of the electorate on behalf of the party. One of the things that was really important, which is not an issue that I had with the gop, was to have the group make an announcement or at least something that was being addressed to their members because they were concerned about the direction these kinds of comments would be. It was our goal to let them know, 'do you support the nra at the gop rally?' And we were very clear when we put together that statement to say, 'yes, you support the nra.' We felt it was a reasonable decision. As far as having no association with any group, at the time, it just seemed like we were in a situation where the gop was just about to be taken over, no one else could make that decision. And it was the first time I was concerned about the direction of the party.So I think there was very little that was done about it, but I was really concerned. And we felt like our message to the general public could be heard if we were there. We felt we had to make sure the right folks heard it, an...
111|When we started playing this game we had some really nice friends we had with us and sometimes I wish I had known some of their families because they were kind of like family. I was looking forward to my first game with them that I had never played before and they were awesome.I've been doing a lot of cross-platform games and I never got bored. I loved the fact that they were pretty much like family and were really supportive. That's one of the big things that I found interesting about the team.So then we hit the ground running with the first demo: we did this. It was pretty much a multiplayer experience, so we went through a very long development process. Our plan was to build a demo about 5-10 days before it ever went to print.The other thing that turned out to be interesting was there's this one guy who you had talked to at some point at the end of the demo. He looked at the game and said something like "I don't like it."What did he say? "I like the combat"?! The guy was like this cool dude. We were like "No, that's probably because we're a team game and we want to make a good action game for a very large scale audience because this audience is in a really big time zone like the u.S." Yeah. Well, then he said to me, "What are we working on for a real game? We'r...
112|It's very, very good. It's very, very bad. It's very, very bad. It's very, very bad that the media gets it wrong. The media got it wrong that you're going to be arrested."Trump's supporters, many of them young, are tired of hearing about clinton, their preferred candidate, who is not only the first woman president but also is the first black president. "There's no question this is hillary clinton's fault. If she's a loser, she should have gotten caught and she should have died," Said trump supporter anthony scaramucci.And now, while many in the press have been waiting for an answer about what happened, some of those who have been watching these events with no previous experience in politics will begin to wonder.In november, the new york times reported that the police were "Deeply embarrassed" About what had happened.During a cnn appearance, the president himself called out for the media to keep it from covering clinton's scandals. (the following is a transcript of the call):q: is there an agreement between all of us — let me ask you on the other hand, you have a series of things going on that you want to focus on, the russia investigation? Are these reports a failure or an indictment or a false flag?Trump: they are a very difficult problem. I think if you look at the story that's written by this reporter...
113|A friend of mine who works in government got a letter that said that a woman asked him if he was going to get married. All the stuff I heard was, "Oh you're going to do that?" And I told him I wouldn't and started asking people to marry me. After 10 years that I told everybody that was wrong and that was it. But then I started to make people marry me, but that was before I did my laundry and stuff."It's hard when you do not know what you're doing and you're doing what you are doing because you may regret it or say whatever you want in terms of you not knowing what you're doing. You need to understand what you're doing is not your job and you may not want to do anything you want. I just want to be happy and healthy, and that's what we have to do.""I would say that I have this feeling that I need to stay on the sidelines. I want to get better. And I don't want to get out as a failure, so I'm doing my best. I want to be able to step up to the plate. I want to play my part and that's where I should be focusing. I want to make sure that I can be successful and that I'm going to be on top of everything. And in those moments, when I feel like I don't feel very focused, it's better to be quiet and kind of have a bi...
114|i was 15 years old, working for a little company in chicago. We had our first meeting for $9.99 when we came in as a "Soul mate." I was a little nervous at first, because I had no idea what to do with my life after that meeting. I just started to really appreciate the work that we're doing in chicago. I didn't know what to do with myself, and I didn't know if I wanted to give up on anything. I got involved with groups and started volunteering with groups and eventually with my own group.Then there were the days when I was still just making money for a group. I didn't know how to spend my money, and so I began to get involved with other people. So, there's a difference between the work of a group or a family living together that I don't know, and a group of the same age. I knew I could help others, and at the same time I knew I could work with other people. So I started to make money. I began writing for a magazine about the world and all of that. That was in 2007, and I was doing it for $10 a page.So when you look back on it from that point forward, you realize just how far you've come, and how many more years it took you to have success. When you take all those years to finally get this kind of success, it's unbelievable how fast you progres...
115|I was a kid, you know, a kid, we were having a lot of fun at recess. The girls from my high school, who used to be the guys at my high school, they would go on the playground when the kids were older, to take a nap. Everybody was laughing at each other. Like, 'oh, how am I doing, you know?'""You were always playing in the corner. It was almost like the playground."A little boy then called out "Buddy, buddy, buddy!" And they stood there, one of them pulling the other girl out of her way. The next thing you knew, they were in the park."My dad told me, 'she's my friend!' And I said, 'yeah, I'm so glad.' ""He never told anyone I knew, or I never really knew anyone else and then I was like, 'ok.' He didn't want me to feel like I wasn't a hero. I had no idea who he was. I wasn't even a kid."He'd gone to the park just to get some toys or something, like a baseball bat."No, he would tell me 'hey, they've got it! It's gonna cost you $40.'""That's because of my dad, but the last thing I wanted to do was throw a monkey in my face because I was never a kid. ...
116|I mean, we were at a bus stop in the city, and a woman just turned around, she says, she came up the steps and she was wearing red lipstick and she saw a man who was about five times her age talking to the women. But the woman said, "You know what, she's going to take them all along. She's got to wear this dress." So the man says, "Look at this guy, he's wearing makeup. He's got this face that looks like a person of my age." And the woman says, "You're not in that position, are you? Now you're out of business." And the man said, "You know what, this is why I'm here. I'm here to say 'no,'" And he was just so funny. And this is why I'm here, because I'm in the business of helping our sisters and daughters, and I'm going to help them understand that you have a responsibility to stay in the business of your family. And you may not look good on the internet, but you've got to be really good at it.Amy goodman: so that's what is going on with your relationship with the internet, your relationship to the country of the south?Daniel kimberg: well, in south africa, we're a democracy. People don't go back to their homes, they go to their shops. They go to their houses and they go t...
117|During the war, I was a member of the first order during a period of high tension and turmoil. I remember there was a terrible fight between three of the first order members, who were soldiers in this area, one with the black lion guard and one with the imperial navy. I was at the end of a battle as one of the three of them shot some of his officers, and I think it was the best fight I fought. I was in charge of one of those guys, and I heard the officer tell me how he was going to make sure that my order was clear that he never would shoot me and he was going to let me be shot. He was going to say, don't call me a traitor, I'm a soldier.I was, of course, in charge of a squad of soldiers that went out, and they were going to help the man who had shot the officer.It took about seven minutes and a half before I was back in action. At that point, I was in charge of the next officer at the same time. There were two people I knew, one in charge of the first order, and one at the same time, in charge of the imperial guard. The one who was in charge at the front was my sergeant, colonel kael, who was a junior infantryman at the time. On my first run across the line of command, I thought I was in the best position to do whatever was necessar...
118|An article on saturday got on our website, and a couple of people who read it had this problem. The headline read:"How to be the real man"And the story got a lot of traction. The idea was that you should be the real guy and that's important.That's why I took a look at some statistics before publishing this article.Statistics don't matterone key factor i've noticed is that statistics do matter in a lot of ways.In general, the more you don't write about what you know and write about what you don't know, the less it should matter.The more you know and write about what you don't know, the harder it is to understand it.When you work together, you have to be transparent about everything you know.You must be open with people and have this kind of clarity you don't see every day.If you don't know everything it's difficult to get it to yourself.This is because you are trying to be true to yourself, not the people around you that are actually telling the truth about you.The more we try to understand you, the harder it is to see it as anything other than a story about you.So here is a simple infographic to help you see this.Here you can see the full size infographic as well as links to all of the resources and source...
119|One of my favorite stories was a movie I had done called, the great escape. I came up with this idea for the great escape and it was a lot of fun, but when I finished the movie, the big deal was, we weren't going to do it again. In the end, we went and made a movie with tim robbins, who was the head of the disney studio, which i've been involved with for 10 years. It was the first time we'd done something with tom cruise that was based on my movie, but we had a lot of great ideas that went into it and some of them stuck.How did you come up with the idea for the great escape?I've been around the movies in a couple of different worlds. In a weird way, I was just sitting there, waiting for a big movie. I was doing a lot of talking in my head and I was thinking, "What the hell is this?" I was just excited to start a new movie.It sounds like it was one of the many reasons you wanted your film to make the jump to digital. You went to the same movie twice, but you could never make the same movie on the digital, so you really wanted to just try and get it on the dvd.In the end, you can't put something like the great escape online, and there were a lot of people like me who loved it. That was kind of what the concept wa...
120|when I was growing up, my dad was an alcoholic. It was around christmas I would go to the movies. But my mom told me she had a lot more friends on tv. I didn't understand what you were doing. She told me your dad was in the hospital and he was dying. I was like, my god. What're you doing?And so on and so forth.Because you were so old, you could not get your father to get his blood count. If he wasn't doing well then he couldn't be able to check in on you. He had his sister who was in prison. So a nurse went to my dad and said, hey, you know, just go out and check in on him. And I was like, it's just too bad a time. I'm so sick, I'm so sick." And she had to go to sleep in the truck and he didn't get home until 4 a.M. And she wasn't going to believe it and she was sick for 30 hours and she couldn't stop thinking about that. Then she went to her doctor and she said, oh, it's just too bad. I've gone through my entire life being sick.But she was doing really good.It was just like, oh, my god. I'm so sick, I'm so sick.Now I realize that her story is a good one because of her sobriet...
121|When I was 15 years old, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The first time I met with someone told me it was all because of me. People told me my mother was always there to help me, and I was never there. We always took care of each other, and it's one of the biggest things you can do on the autism spectrum. Now I don't know where I fit in. I don't see the autism spectrum at all. But, it was always going to go into my family. And, I was a teacher, teaching. I was always working on my own, and I was always the only girl on stage. I got to a point where I could take care of myself in my own way. My family was always there to help me out. I would give things away when I needed them, and when I wanted to. I was also going through a really bad time. When I went to college and my career got shut down, there were so many new people in the school. My professor was just so shocked that I was a student. I could barely walk. I was still trying to learn to read and write, but my friends were telling me that I had no interest. Eventually, something went wrong in my relationship. I got a job from a friend in my class, and a lot of my friends knew me. Some said they knew how to talk to me. I was like, "Oh, it's all right. I'm doing goo...
122|I've never really had a problem with anyone ever having their hand on my laptop. It's not like they know what they're doing. It's something they haven't talked to me about. It's really a privilege to talk to my partner. And it's something I'm looking forward to doing.I'm a software engineer, and i've known that for years. But when I started my first company, I was really, really nervous about it. It was just like, I'm not going to believe anything you say.One day, when I was in the office and talking with a guy who was working in his spare time, he told me he would come in and ask me what I'm doing when I leave. And I said, "Well, that's a great question, but I'lltell you what you should do, because it probably won't be right."He went on to say that if I don't do the job right, I'llgo out and do it wrong. But you know what. I had a guy who asked me, "How does that work?" And I said, "I could do it, but it's better." And it kind of worked for him because he knew he was doing the job right and he could do it better than I would.So, he went right back and told me and said, "You can't tell her what you're doing...
123|a few years ago, I went to work at a bookstore, an independent bookstore that i've never been to. I went to see a book by a girl named rebecca gentry that had been published by borders and that she was doing a really wonderful exhibition. She was really beautiful, and there was actually over a thousand copies of that book that I had, along with all the other great books that this country had, all the wonderful books that were out there that she had published. I had just gotten up to come to her house for a dinner, and there were four very beautiful women at the table that were actually very very interested in what I was doing, so they just sat down. And they were saying, "Do you have any more books, you know?"It's just the last two volumes of the adventures of the dog." [laughs.] she was really kind of talking to them about it, and then there were a couple of books that I had that were amazing, and one of those, and two of those, and so on.And it was an incredibly personal experience for me. I just said, "I don't want to be in any other bookshop. I don't want to take any more money from this bookstore that I'm going to take from you. I can't afford to take any more money from it. I'm going to take whatever money I have when I die."That moment was just a revelatio...
124|In the late 1960s, I was working on a game called "The gameboy edition," But the director had given me permission to have a game called the game boy advance, which I had never made before. (in the early 70s, a friend who had worked on a game called "Super mario bros." Called me a nutbag, and the producer was like, "Don't tell him we did that!" The game was called "Super mario bros.")the publisher that I worked with called me a nutbag,and for a while, I was working on it. I could see that there were people who wanted to develop the game. And then I noticed that there was another publisher, that had a game called atari's the gameboy edition that they had. They were very interested in the game and asked me if I could play it. I didn't want to tell anybody else. They wanted to build me an nes emulator. I was very curious to see how much I could do. As I left, I saw people who were interested in the gameboy and wanted to get it, but they were not willing to make any money and they were so eager to try the game that the publisher told me that they could only build it at their own cost if they made money out of it.So, I called atari and said, "Are you serious? How do you do it?"They gave me $2,000 to $...
125|my brother's dad was in his 40s. He was a good and decent person. My brother was just playing with my mother and I was just making sure we were ok.He was trying to figure out if we were going to go out with him or not. His brother was also trying to figure it out for him.The last time I went to school was like a year ago.He walked down to the front door. He was just walking around with his head down. This guy was just like, 'do you want to go?' And we said, 'no, but we have a great relationship with our mom. And we have a great relationship."She said he thought he looked like a kid and that it just made him look like a kid. She said he looked so much like a kid.But she said in that moment it made him look like he was out of his mind.He said he was a better person than he was a year ago. That was when I saw him.He said that when I got out of college and my dad got a letter from my mom telling him he had to go back, he would have been okay.He said I could have just gone with him, so I said sure.After I got out of college he said, "You're a nice kid. But you're not going to win this race."I sai...
126|Some years ago, I lost my father in battle. What do you remember about that? I remember how he put his hands on a soldier's shoulder before he died. And then he would take two small children. And one of them would start singing like he was going to die. So I said, 'just remember, how lucky he was, how lucky he was that we could have him, because he would have loved us so much, that he'd come home so strong, with so many wonderful people in his life to keep it alive.' "It's been almost two years since, and i've still not been told about the incident of his last-minute escape from his parents, or about his last-minute escape from the army. My first report (after learning about it a long time ago) was that I had forgotten he was at a hospital. I told my staff that, in his last few months, I'd been in the military, and he'd been out on an overseas deployment. When I came back to him after two months, he was still in intensive care as his parents took him to a local hospital. When I asked him to come over, he told me that, since his parents had lost their son, he'd been in "War zones".I told him that when he returned home, he'd be wearing his purple heart, and the blood he'd shed when he broke out of vietnam would be on a silver platter. H...
127|We're dealing with a child who's just 6 years old. As you can imagine, this is very scary, and I'm trying to put it to good use. The first time I met my kid (he was 5), I gave him so much. He was almost a complete stranger. I told him that I wasn't into physical play or anything but he just loved me. I didn't care what the language was but he loved talking to me. My whole life I was like 'hey, I just love you'. He loved everyone. I tried to play with him but he always kept his eyes open.My wife and I have had a hard time understanding how kids play. When you see a kid doing something physically uncomfortable, you know it's probably something normal, or inappropriate. But my son is really loving and is getting the kids to play, they're so happy. I know, it's difficult to say, it's really sad because that's how you deal with those. I think it's the hardest thing to relate to. When I hear about a child who is a physical freak just like me, I feel for them. It's scary.The other thing we have talked about for the past month or so, was that there were lots of questions he was doing. I think he was doing a lot of things he thought didn't feel right. For example, he was really good at picking up a book and then he started to read it wit...
128|when I was a kid, my dad ran into me on the street, and he went, "Oh, I'm a kid, you're going to be a really proud black man, you're going to win the lottery." And I did, and the kids did the rest. And they were such proud because they weren't going to be discriminated against. We were very proud.There's a couple of things that the media don't know about you. We were born in the segregated south. But what do you make of this? You said you were white and now you're african-american. Do you feel like you can relate to your experience in the country? What do you think about this?I want to understand that it's not that I feel like I'm white. I wanted to be a kid, because I really wanted to be a kid. If that were true, I would have done what I did. I would have gotten over my depression, because I remember my mom, who was a teacher, and she was like, "I'm gonna take you back to what you were, and let you do what you want to do, and make sure you have the best body possible, with proper hair, with decent clothes, and a good body for yourself."My parents are black. They're very proud for that. They're very proud, and I think that is something that we can all relate to. But I have ...
129|One of the first things one saw when I was a boy and I'm not talking about my dad, when he got back in his teens, he was the kind of guy that everyone liked to hang out with everybody, and I was living in a different part of new york and I got to see this really old guy and it was an old lady walking a little bit to the grocery store and she told me the story. She was with a young guy, and it was the first time I went out to his place, and he said, "Oh, that's really cool. Where's your dad?" And I said, "Oh, my daddy's in this bar. He's gone to work." And I said yeah. His friend got on, and I was like, "This is incredible." And he was like, "Wait a minute." He said, "Oh, my dad's got his work, so it's like, this is crazy. I don't know. Where's his school?" And I was like, "There's a bar right there," And I said, "Oh, my dad's doing something." And she's like, "No, you guys don't do anything." It was a family friend I was friends with who had just met my brother, and they were like, "Oh, my dad's on his way back to school."I also watched the mtv program about "The last supper," And I realized I didn'...
130|Our mom and dad got caught up in this thing where they were walking along the street, and a red car was speeding by. All we wanted was to go there and get my kids, but it was just too bad it was a little too late. I remember the kid was running away, and his hand was so far behind him, and she jumped up and ran away. We don't know why she ran away. It's kind of an eerie feeling, but the way she was holding on to her hand, that it was over there, and she knew she was hurt, didn't she? It felt like just about every time she ran, she would get up, pull it off, and throw off the car. When it didn't move, it was too late."In another episode of the amc docu-series "The walking dead," The episode was called "Someday, the whole town will see that red car, the cops will come because it's over there."Relate...
131|The first thing that occurred to me was the fact that I'm a young man. At the time, I knew I was a boy. I didn't feel like I had the right to be in this world. I didn't want to go through this thing I didn't want to go through. So I went to a therapist. I went to a psychiatrist. I came here. He said that he had found that what he had found there was actually the truth about all these things that had been going on. And I said I did not want to be in this world. And then I said at that moment the world became so much more frightening because I realized that I wanted to be a woman. So I said I wasn't going to give up the world. And I did not want to fight the man. I wanted to take the responsibility. I said the only way to fight the man was to become a better man and not take that same mistake that I had made.This was my first encounter with an adult. I was 23 years old. I was a child. I had never been to an adult's funeral or college. So I knew my future was at stake. So by the time I got to college, I was 20. So I was already a woman in this world. I had the ability to be the best person in that world. So I came to college. I graduated. I went to college. I was accepted. And it was only after tha...
132|a guy was watching an hbo show. He was so drunk that he had to stand on the couch in the middle of the night watching. He got up and got into a car with this guy and got shot. A guy says to him, "Hey, look, your name is dave. He's the guy who's taking over his company, the studio. Dave owns hbo. He owns hbo, and he makes some amazing games like call of duty and halo, and, all of a sudden his company is selling out to other companies. He's like, 'yo, I don't know how you made the money, but I think you made enough money. I think you made $4 billion. You're making $4 million a year.'"This story was told by an actual game developer.And that's what this happened.And he was like, "What? Oh, this is what I said that I thought I could do in two hours. I guess we'll just sit here and do that. It would be so good."And he was like, "No, no, no, dude, let's do that. I do know how to make money. I know how to make $4 million. Let's put on two shows and have a good time. I'm just waiting until I can buy a house and have a happy life there. You can buy this house, and I'm not here to make money fo...
133|It starts as I was finishing up my lunch and realized that my sister was still wearing jeans. I started to tell her about my sisters experiences, but she wasn't understanding. I had no idea what she was talking about. Then, she began asking if I knew where my sisters' cars are. How I was going to put up with that. I told her I knew and then she asked how could I possibly explain this to her without being rude. I didn't know what to say, so I thought I would make it okay for her. "We just drove right through the red zone. What?" She asked. I responded that I wouldn't ask her if she had a car or not. She knew the answer. That's when I began to wonder. I had to ask her. How would she describe this? What was her car like, her height and weight? What was it like? How was she dressed, how was she dressed? Were I going to explain anything to her? What would this feel like for her? Would it be like I told her that I had a car or that she had a friend she didn't know? Would she get upset or hurt? She knew what I was talking about. I didn't need to worry about it being her fault. I didn't know any of these things at the time. I just knew she was thinking about me and didn't want to upset anyone. How could this not be her fault? She was being nice an...
134|You saw these people come on the show, and I think I said to myself, "What could they be doing? Why are they here, talking to the world?" What would they be doing in the world? I mean, what the hell does that even mean? Do them have any idea what they're doing in the world? Where are they going to be when they get there with all these guns? They're always going in like these weird, crazy worlds!" And so then the show starts off on a cliffhanger. The end of the show. It gets like a really sad ending, like a weird ending. But as I watched it, it felt really good to get the real end of the show on the show, and to feel like the end wasn't actually in this show, but that it wasn't actually happening.You guys did show that the show can't be really successful without its audience.Yeah, I mean, it's a lot more difficult to have that kind of success without the community. I mean, it's something that exists, because I mean, I do it every season when I'm on the show. It's a lot harder to do it even if somebody said, "You wanna show it because you think it's really good?" Or, "You want it because you think it's good because it's a show that I think shows all of these things." I think it's really great to see the way we approach thing...
135|My friend and I were on our way from our hometown to a meeting in the desert. A friend of mine and I walked up and over to my friend's house on the other side of the road. He walked around on the other side and started talking about how much he hated the military. He wanted us to think that it's a bunch of bad guys that make our society worse. I said to him, "You know what, maybe you had better think for a moment. You know what? You better go tell the truth," And that happened. This is what made it so that he gave up and stayed by his side.I was at that meeting and a man came up around me, he came looking for us, a bunch of guys in dark suits and holding the weapons. I didn't know what he was looking for, but that man told me to look down the list and I did. He said, "I think we ought to go down there and see what the guns are." I said, "You don't have to, don't know what the guns are," And I went down there and he looked at me and said, "What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I'm gonna kill you and take your rifle and I'm gonna shoot you. You shouldn't have to look like that, either." He said, "No, you have to be stupid." I said, "I want the rifle, I want to b...
136|an entrepreneur who is very good at what he does isn't actually the best at anything and does it with such ease he has no real power over what he does.So, even in the company of someone who is very good at everything, he's still working as he can as fast as he can pull it together and he's still trying to make something good out of it. The problem is that when he gets his hands on it, he is so slow that it's all very easily broken up into small pieces that he has to keep working hard and it takes him a long time to figure out what he needs to do.The other problem is that when we're all in the business of building things, we don't really need a lot of time to get it done. If we're all in the business of building things, there's no need for us to really do much more than focus on getting things done quickly, and when it comes to building things, it's really not very good.This is the problem that I'm talking about. When we've built things for four or five years, we still don't know when it's going to be time to start rebuilding the business. When we've built things for a year, it's like our business is starting to collapse for some reason, as we get better at making things we think we can get better at.And that's exactly what happened to me when I decided to star...

"How could I possibly get myself out of this?""Well, I guess I can," I said. "It's not like I could get back into this here. I'm in this, I'm out of.""It's about time you stopped being so quiet," He said, looking around. "I never want to leave this. It's about time you stopped being so quiet.""I don't know if I can get to the end, but I hope you're starting to get used to it. I hope you get used to me getting to the end of this.""So…" I said."I don't like that the word 'unofficial' is always used here," He said."No matter what it is," I said, "It's just a word. But it's an official word.""And that's what makes it so easy to be your brother?""It's a word," He said. "But, it's also a word. It's the word that makes this game so much easier to play. It's the word that makes the game so much easier to beat. It's the word that makes it so hard to just put a gun to my hea...
138|I'm talking to the young american parents who have been the breadwinners of our country. They are not the ones with the kids and a college degree. They are the ones who got educated and were on the ballot this spring. And they think that it would make any of it better. But they have been lied to, they have been lied to, they've paid bribes. And they think they're being lied to for their vote by a group of people who think they are being told they are not.I know that you're a proud progressive, but I know that every one of us is working through this nightmare as a nation. Some of us have spent weeks trying to make good on the promise we made during the democratic primaries.But there are many, many more people who will suffer for this. And they're going to have to think about what to do so that they can help make a difference, not just in the presidential election, but in the future. The future doesn't matter much to them because they know their futures.But they're also going to have to think about what they can do to help those children and their grandchildren.It's not like I'm giving up hope in my life, because my life has been filled with tragedy. I've watched the devastation of hurricane katrina. I've watched the devastation of sandy. I've watched the devastation of the civil war, the fighting in gaza. But this is just a smal...
139|This morning, my mother and I were out on the town, and my aunt sat on her porch, and my mother said to me, "Mother, I don't believe your theory that you're telling the truth." I was thinking, "Well, I'm still trying." My aunt said, "I've seen so many people come and go before me, so they're trying to be like this or that. They'll tell everyone what they want to hear or talk about. And I knew that there were three of all these black men down the street, and they were all going in on this black man. This black man was trying to get away from them. And then he came back and said, "They don't want it," And that's what the whole thing looked like. So I went and talked to some of those black people down the street, just looking at each other."And then I went and talked to my cousins. And you know what? I went back to our house. And then I went back to my parents.Amy goodman: so you were looking at that whole thing and you said, "I want to tell you something." Because that was what my mother was telling me, a story about the black men. And then you said, "Oh, look, we're going to get that story out of here." And then you came back to my mother telling me the whole story. And you said, "Well, we'r...

141|I live in brooklyn, new york. I am an employee of a company called big pharma. I work for an investment fund and I am a doctor with the national institutes of health. I am a member of the national academy of sciences which is a peer-reviewed institution with a long history of research. In my field of science, I have been doing research into how the liver works and how cancer affects it. My colleagues, colleagues, and patients are working hard to discover ways to reduce or stop this terrible disease.I was the lead investigator of a paper that demonstrated that a treatment could significantly reduce cancer risk in people with genetic diseases, but not all of them. It was a good article, a great piece, and it turned out to be the breakthrough we needed. The authors of the study — dr. Christopher linn — were very skeptical and they didn't give me any sort of grant. The main reason they gave me was that after I looked at the data and made my own findings, they came to the conclusion that it would be very nice to have a single treatment from which to make this treatment.Now this is kind of something I was asked to do, and I did: the first treatment study I ever performed was by my colleague, and she gave me that treatment. So we went through an entire project, researching the effects that treatments could have, from the effects of treatment, to the effects of the treatment when one treatment is taken. We asked tw...
142|i spent the night in a hotel room surrounded by the rest of the world. It was the least I could do. When I arrived at my destination I made a few apologies to my wife: I'm going to be late. I wanted to say hello.I went in for a couple hours of talk therapy, and I ended up in the bathroom. I told the therapist, "Don't worry about it! I've got a lot to talk about for you. I just wanted to leave you alone for a whole day, maybe even a little bit."He started to tell me that, if I told him my feelings of inadequacy were, in fact, real, it would make him jealous.What a great way to end up. I didn't have to ask for it. He just wanted to stay away from me.I started telling him that it would make him jealous of things that were real. It would make him think I was lying to my wife. "No!" He would yell in frustration, and I would tell my wife to ignore him.He started telling me that at least for a while he was happy that I wasn't. That maybe I was selfish, but I could trust him. He told me, "Don't worry about it! You're not going to be around me for days before I get to you."I went into the office that night with the therapist, and he started tellin...
143|Last november, I heard a story on your site, and then it ran through my head.My wife was doing yoga at the gym, and I told her.She said, "Don't do yoga, I wouldn't do yoga for five minutes."So I said no, I wouldn't do it for five minutes.So I told her, "Well, let's just stop because I know you guys are making fun of yourself."And I said, "Yeah, I'm doing that because I'd do it for five minutes and I would feel weird."Her answer is a resounding no.She says, "Yeahit's just that I wouldn't be doing that if I didn't.So I did it.She said, "Oki just thought I'd just stop doing it, because I didn't know."Well, I said, "Well, I know how to do that, but I just don't have time."Now, I'm not sure if I was doing that or if that was because she just didn't understand."But you're only doing this if you've got a great time."...

No, it wasn't.You said that you were scared to go to your room and just shut the doorwas that a lie?Was that not what it was doing inside the house? Did you know that?Yeahthe drugs didn't hurt at allthey just turned the other cheek.Did he really say that to you?Nohe didn't.Were there any other substances then? Did you use them to help the family escape?Was that your drug use at that time? Did you ever use drugs?...
145|over the course of my first few meetings, I was introduced to an acquaintance in my field, and my introduction led to dinner with him. It was a very formal meeting, very respectful, very intimate and warm.I went to the meeting room and sat down to eat with him, but he was very open with respect. I would usually tell stories of our lives, but it turned out that he was very kind towards me. His kindness had a huge influence on me. He was open to my suggestions, and I could talk about my work and what he wanted from me.I learned a lot about him, and I was encouraged to speak more, but he wanted me to stay true to it. In fact, I would stay true to him because I could help him with his business, and I could help him create jobs for my own children. In fact, I'd like to believe that he has the experience of a very important man, and it is a miracle that he will come to my place of work, and I am hopeful that he will continue to work well. Because as long as he doesn't leave town, he will continue.I was introduced to a number of young men and women from my own school, in my own community. There was a particular time in which I had to learn so much about them, in order to get to know them better. I met a great many of them, most of whom are really good peopl...

148|I have known people for some time where they've never had a child. It's not that i've never had one because my dad had my brother and I could never go, let alone see my child. I didn't even know he was there for me for that.My dad would give me this blanket with his face in it in the back of the bus and say, "You know, maybe you can have a baby next month. I'm so sorry, but you'll have to watch the whole thing with this blanket." And then I was like, I hope this blanket doesn't get too big.So I took him to my parents and he was like, okay, I'llgive you this blanket and put my little foot down and you'll get this little foot down so I don't have to watch the whole thing, but I would like to help make that happen so you can have a baby next month."I was like, well, yeah.And he's just like, okay, you know, it's something that you probably didn't know existed because I never had one.But I felt like this was something that was like, well, that was something that I wasn't really interested in. He's like, okay, you gotta watch it, see it. So I said, I'm okay with this, but you gotta make sure you watch it if you want. And he gave me this blanket with this blanke...
149|A couple of years ago, my husband was talking to somebody. He said, "How many times have you met him?" We sat down and he started talking about how he had met his wife. "What the hell am I talking about?" He asked. I said, "But I met the guy who met his wife back in the '90s." It sounds like he was right. He had met her. She knew him and she wanted him to meet her. He was going to meet her because she was having a break. He hadn't met her before.It was very strange because I was like, "No, I'm not going to tell this story because it's not good enough for them." I know I'm not going to tell the story because I don't want people to know about it. But I also know that the story was told to me. At this point, it's very emotional, and this was very emotional. I knew that these were my two kids. It was a wonderful experience for me because then my husband told me, "He's telling me the good news." He said, "Your wife is getting married. It's the best thing that ever has happened to you." So I was excited and I felt like I really had to do something. I wanted them to know that it was a good thing. I felt like I had to start over. Once a year, if you do this, and you meet a guy, yo...

I know when that happened I couldn't stop being kind of scared," He said. "I don't think I'llever stop being kind of scared because I know I have a good heart and I know that I am being kind of brave and that I have hope. There is nothing better than being kind of like, I just know that I have hope.""I do so much for you because you are my hero now and I love you for it," He continued. "I can't thank you enough for the love you've been with me for over a year. You have changed my life. My dad was there with me in those days. I don't know how I can forget. I love you, I love you.

151|I have been to a lot of movies and I am always amazed how much people love them. They are all amazing. I was a huge fan of the lord of the rings when I saw it and there were so many wonderful films I watched and they are some of the best. But with so many great guys, it's crazy to think they will never be able to share this with anyone else. But it is what it is, so you know I would love to see it too and I hope they don't find it too much fun.But it's a good thing they are here. We will hear their voice and hopefully we will all become good friends because they have a very unique perspective on our world, so all right how can you share this with us too?I feel like I want to share this with you because I thought I had to. And I wanted to say something about your character.No, I really did not want to. I did not want to tell you this, I just wanted to tell you that you are beautiful and special and that I do love you and I hope you will take one more photo of me with me so I can show you some love.Now, I am very sorry he will never see you again.No, you do not have to. We are all friends and I will not go into a million details that you did not understand, or how.Yes you do, very wel...
152|In 2004, I had a lot of conversations with some of my friends. They all had this idea: "This is the beginning of a whole new era of being an independent person." And I was like, "What's the point of this, man?" They really said, "Who do you want to be as a director?" It's really just me doing an album, and I'm like, "You know, it's a whole other thing. It's not about me being a director." And then they said, "You know, what are we going to do with that." I would say something similar or I'd say something completely new. But I guess that's how it started with me doing all these things. Then the concept for what I was doing comes about in the beginning, and I'm doing stuff that's more personal. Like, "This isn't about me being responsible. This isn't about me being a musician. This isn't about me being a person." It was all about, "This is what I'm going to be, that's what I'm going to do." And then I'm just like, "No, it's just, we're gonna get this idea right." That's how it all started. Even now we're still doing all these different things, and it's just really exciting.It's so exciting to say the least.[laughs] right.Did you ever imagine that you'd get ...
153|It is not for a minute; you would like to share about that one with your friends.A friend of mine was in the bathroom with a small group of us. We had walked by her house one night. She had just gotten her daughter out of bed and she thought it was a good idea to tell us about it when we arrived. Apparently she noticed the man who sat in her bathroom reading a book just before she walked out! She didn't say anything to help him figure it out. No one did.Later, I noticed her looking up at him. She was looking at a book that was in a drawer on the table, just above the sink. She had picked it up.As I was talking to her friend, she gave me a quick smile and said, "You know, it is a problem I had with my mom before. She came by the house without telling anyone. I had to ask her. She kept me in bed for a short time. So I had to ask her, 'do you want me to leave?' And she said yes. And there was nothing. She was just sitting there with her eyes closed. And she never came back."This was really the first time I'd ever heard her say it out loud, so I didn't want to say anything. I wanted to let it be known that she had never told anyone, that I was the one who was the target.I took som...
154|The first thing I did was go to the church and I did not see any of the children in that school who were just playing. So I walked in to the school, looked for them and found just two of the boys from one of the girls. I asked the first lady at the next level to explain it. He said there are two boys from both of the children and they got one of them and two boys from another boy…and then it was taken down to the church. [there were two more boys from the other children]. Then we went to the church and sat down. There were only two of them. The pastor was very respectful. He did not talk to me about what had happened. He just said that everybody should get along. So I walked in the church and found two of the boys that were playing in the church and walked up to them. I asked if there was something wrong. He said that all they were doing was getting down there and playing with and it was no problem. It was a very happy day. The next day the first lady told me that they had a church meeting in the church and that this was an opportunity to have a normal meeting. In the church there were two different members…and one of them had a large bible reading, so I went into the room and asked each member if there was anything they could help. I asked if there was anything they couldn't help. They all agreed that there was nothing, and that we neede...
155|One day, I see my wife in the hospital with my eyes closed. She's bleeding from her face, and I can feel blood coming from her mouth! We were there about 15 minutes ago, and I'm still not clear about her condition. She looks like she was struck by lightning or something or something, and she's in shock. It was like she just ran off her feet and the doctors didn't know what to do.I'm still in shock. I had never seen anything like that before or since. The doctors said it was pretty severe, but I kept trying to get her to go back in the hospital because I think they should have treated her better. The doctors took her in an ambulance and took her through the hospital with a wheelchair. I'm so glad I did it.So as soon as I saw the doctor and the surgeon, which was really cool and reassuring, I got ready to walk out of there. I was about 4:45 in the morning. I was walking around with my hands out on my hips and legs doing cardio. I went up and put my hands up to her face and she started crying. Then I told my wife that that was what they should have done.My mom said, "If you have to tell her, call us, we'll do it as long as it's safe for her." I didn't care a lot about that one because I wasn't doing anything. I couldn't go...
156|He was so happy to hear his fellow countrymen. He sat with the horses outside, and he said, 'i'm happy to see you. We have got a lot of work to do; let's go now.' "The group turned their back to the road and went out to the river. They were on a hill overlooking it, and they saw that the river had been reduced to a stream. The road was in the middle of a broad field; but, as the horse fell, the line of the river narrowed, and the horses began to go."I was so surprised," Recalls dr. Shaver. "I was so very proud of this horse. It was the only one I'd ever used. I've never seen a horse so much like him. When he got up the hill, I just took off his horse-gown and ran inside the church."The horses were very excited to run, and he was quite sure that if he got inside this church, one day he might know how to swim."But that was just the beginning. When he went into the chapel the whole congregation would come around it, to see how he could do something so incredible. And he was so excited as he got up the hill to run through the open church. I'd been so proud to be part of that. But you could see he didn't know."You really see this man's enthusiasm for adventur...

But at the same time, I want to make sure that you guys know that when they say, "Hey, I'm still a young guy," It is going to happen for a long time.You're getting out there with the same mindset that you do all the time.I want to make sure when we step in as a team, that we go out there and do the things we need to do. And those are the things we're looking toward as a young team.I don't think we're ready to go out and do things, but then you do it and it happens. And then you're looking at the next step in life and you know what happens? You have to do tha...
159|One day, I was walking through her neighborhood, where I lived in my hometown, when I saw her and we didn't see the same kind of eyes. It was just a really weird feeling to be in the same neighborhood, to walk through that house. I was like, 'hey my house is such a tiny piece but here I am.' And she said, 'i'm sitting here with that face and there is no one else there.' And she said, 'don't you think this is why you have these stares, you don't know how big things are?' So I said, 'i can say that because they don't know anything.' What happened? The kids didn't know, I thought. But, after a little while, I knew there were kids out there that saw this beauty, and I thought about trying to explain their reactions. And I started to think about what they are seeing. And I think when you see something of this sort, it makes it seem bigger than it actually is.And then it happened to a friend. A friend of hers came up to me after a few weeks, and asked me if I had seen what this guy was seeing. And I had to take him out of my life, and I told him I wasn't seeing anything but a man. And he wasn't a man, but an alien. And I had to give him back to the world, to humanity. And I said, 'do you want to hav...
160|back in may of last year, the day I moved to california from my high school years, I came across a beautiful little apartment on the corner of the block and got into an altercation with someone.I was driving to my girlfriend's apartment at the time with my parents. My mother sat at her side and she asked me to stay next to her. A few months later, I was sitting in her living room when I heard the man yelling, "I'm sorry you're hurt, your dad kicked your ass." I was shocked. I was devastated, I was shocked. And I took to facebook to share that my mother had kicked my ass.I'm so sorry.And in the span of one month I started posting pictures of the man. My mother was very upset. I'm sitting here in the living room with tears in my eyes saying I was wrong.And the next day we met up in my condo. I'm so sorry.Just when I was about to put a picture up, I heard it being told that a man had kicked my ass. That somebody had threatened to kill me if I showed up.And I was so upset that it was called a "Terrorist attack" And I got up and sat next to my girlfriend.And after about 30 seconds they started talking about who had kicked me. Who did the "Blame" On. Who told them where the assault took place...
161|One of the people that I interviewed, she was a woman. A black widow. Her mother was a woman. She had come back in 1995, and she had a daughter. We talked for 15 minutes, she was about to go for a bath, and she said she didn't want to go to the water fountain for six or seven minutes, and then she said, "I can't go. I don't want to go. I don't want to go to the pool." And I said, "I love you, but why can't I go?" And she said, "Because I never wanted to go to the pool at all and it's like it's a big, big, big black hole in the earth." And so, when she came out of [the pool] and we went to go for a bath, she said, "I don't want to go. I want to go to the pool. I want to go. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. So, she said, "I love you, but why can't I go?" And I said to her, "Why can't I go? Because what am I really going to do?" And she said, "If I wanted to stay in the pool, I would have to go to the pool right now. And I was just like, "I love you, but why can't I go?" Because how can I say, "Oh my god...
162|When I was in elementary school, my principal, one of my teachers, was having a difficult time and told me that if I would only take a few more minutes to read the book, my school students would be in a better place. My teacher, I assume, just didn't believe me.A couple weeks ago I heard news that the federal bureau of investigation would not take over the national security of the american police force. I was not allowed to read or speak on the matter. I had my freedom and my civil liberties suspended immediately. I was even asked to leave the national guard and moved out of town.I was told that the police force would not be going to a place like this. I was told I was just 'not going to believe anything you say.'I went to the fbi and was told that if I had lied about what I was doing and why I was being asked to leave the fbi or go to the united states. That was immediately followed by a complete and total blackout in my ability to walk off the fbi property. I was also told that every time I tried to walk off the fbi property I would face a criminal prosecution for violating the fourth amendment. I had never been caught doing that. All of this was absolutely and very true.I didn't know how I would be punished if I said my story about being in a car accident in the summer of 2014 was true.I was in the classroom at firs...
163|I was a very young guy. I'd always been a writer, I was raised in new york and a lot of my friends live in south and some of them had been writers. They grew up in los angeles and some of them worked in magazines. They came from very far away. There's some of the same story. One of my friends was married to a former friend of theirs and they're young, they're in their 30s, they're good people and they're very successful. Their story is a little bit different. For instance, I had a very successful career working with kids, I did a couple of commercials for the new people and I was working as a child-counselor for a little business. At one point at school I was teaching to kids and one of them said to me, "You wanna write a story for children, what would you want in your life?" So I wrote an entire article for a magazine for the kids that had not been in school but I'd been working for some years for the boston globe. That's part of my job and the story is that I was the first person to see it and i've been working on it for some time now. I had the chance to write it. On one of my first day of school I told my kids my love, because they had such a beautiful face. The kids said, "How lovely, how beautiful! How beautiful how beautiful!" I thought it was funny, it wa...
164|My wife was born in the mid 19th century."I did my best to think this through without getting too emotional. "That's what I think from a very young age."This morning, on her third day off from work, she and I began a new relationship as a matter of course. She was a lovely young lady with amazing ideas that could change the world as a whole. But I thought she needed a bit of love and I didn't want to be too sweet.My daughter's mother and I are deeply affected by the fact that our family is such a powerful community of faith. The words I use to describe our families are: "I have no interest in politics. I do not care about my children. I am merely interested in what is important to them."My daughter was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 16 but as I was taking care of her, I began to talk to her about marriage, about her daughter's love, her ability to speak truth to power.I learned some things about marriage: she loves her husband and she loves her family. She wants her child to be more engaged and connected than her husband. But the family is still what we consider the "Family" Of faith, and that is what we want our daughter to be.My daughter is the daughter of a married family. Her mother took her from a father who was more active in his life to a man who was more active in himsel...
165|Your friend and colleague has been driving down the streets of portland, oregon to visit their family. This is a wonderful job. Your colleague is in his mid-20s. The friend's job is to take care of the children. My two children — ages 7 and 11 — are in high school. You and your colleague have put the family first. You put your family first. What do you do here? You don't work there. You have just been given free time to care for children. I've been there with your colleague and his kids for nearly seven years and my family has been very supportive. One of your colleagues came to the meeting and said a couple of things, saying, "You know, we have been asking for your time, but you and your colleague are here now, and you should take some time off." We are very much grateful for that time. So, they said a couple of times, if you let it go for six months, it could be your last job for you for some other period of time. So, I said, "Ok." So, I do understand that you and your colleague are here for some time, but I would appreciate that your time and the time you spent on the road with your family is gone, as well as the time you spend on your family and that you know, you want to make sure that he doesn't get too attached to you."So, I'm here because I'm a parent living i...
166|i remember my first year at stony brook university, I got some money for a $25 class. I was the only female student. It was a very strange time, and I wasn't a fan of male privilege. I would get very angry when I heard that girls were not paid to play the piano. "What's that?" I thought. Then, when I was a sophomore, my class came up with a joke on my back that told how boys should never beat a girl. And we had the boys play the piano, too, and there I was, singing with my classmates. So there I was, wearing a white hat and no pants."You don't have to dress like that." That's a big joke. You're a girl. And then I had to give up. It was weird: I really liked how the class was doing things."When I was studying at stony brook, I thought, I'm going to be an astronaut." I was a really good student.It didn't matter what I was doing. I had no idea what the class was doing. It made me think, I'm a man. "Would you like me to take you out to a party?" I would have no reason to. I'd go to a restaurant and get drunk there.And it was that party, that party, that party I stayed at that was so weird. I thought, i've had t...
167|i have one of my older boys growing up. Three years ago the two men from our high school. He was an all time, high school all school guy. He always wanted to be a writer.One of the guys, who is also my middle brother. I was just a freshman. He was trying his best to be a writer. As a sophomore, he came in and they were shooting the film, and he wrote, "I'm gonna start a book. I'm gonna write an entire novel. The next thing I know, he's in a big truck, he's driving down the road and he's shooting the trailer." He was just super excited.It was so cool. It was like I was looking at someone and saying "You know, I know that I'm going to love this!" He just went crazy with me. He asked me why I was doing this. So he said, "You mean you wanted to be a writer? So you got that experience in you? How was the experience of being a writer?" And I was like, yeah, I just wanted to be a writer. We started shooting together and it was the perfect meeting for us. I mean, he was like, "You know what, I can handle all that stuff, man? I get it. But he's got me in his head."So we started shooting, and he was like, "I love writing. Can I just d...
168|I'm a young man from san antonio, on a working-class farm. He's always had a job, but his family is poor and his kids don't have jobs. I grew up on a farm, but I'm in a family with little money. And if I was poor, I would never have started a business. In america, when a rich guy gets rich, the world knows he's a millionaire and a billionaire doesn't deserve to be rich.You've said the problem of inequality is a false equivalence between the rich and poor. Can you elaborate on your claim?It's true that I was a middle-class boy, and I never got any college degrees. When I got a job, I went on vacation, and my kids stayed home for a few years. But, on that trip, we lived in the same apartment we had. Now, when I get a job, I work at mcdonald's. When I got a new job, I go to new york city. I get into a car to get to work.And then you went to college?Yes, I did.I was a student in college.Can you explain what led you to earn your bachelor's degree?Well, I was working in a bank. The bank manager told me that I needed to borrow on a credit card, but I didn't know anything about credit cards. So, I borrowed for a yea...
169|Some of the people in the world who know my name are friends with the clintons. So many of these people have ties in their own family business. But they have no connection to the clintons. And because they don't have anything to do with our campaign, they are never gonna have any money on their side.Amy goodman: so what exactly are the people in the crowd trying to do?Mary daniel: well, the fact is that these people have been working for so long, at a very high level, that they have no idea what's going to happen during the election. And, you know, some of them have been trying to get the democrats to give amnesty to millions of illegal aliens and to bring back all of the jobs that were lost. And others have taken advantage of our tax cuts to help them pay for their own campaign, and other people have been giving speeches at every stage of the campaign to show them who won. There are a number of folks in this crowd who are getting paid to do the work of the clintons, and others who want to get the money back. But we are being watched. I mean, we do have people in different parts of the country like that that want to do work for the clintons. Some of the other people who come down the hall with me are doing things in favor of the democrats, and some of them are supporting the democrats, but most of these people are sitting over here doing nothing.

170|You were a young lad growing up in the united states, a kid who had his father's name engraved on his forehead. A man named george w. Bush came from the same family of families that were the cause for my grandfather's name. It wasn't just that the name changed. It really changed my identity. It was that I was the first one that was identified by god as being the one to save the world from an evil being who was trying to destroy it.The fact is that I was born on march 27th, 1971. I was born in california, my father, robert, was the great poet who was a teenager in los angeles and was studying at harvard. I was also on an aa class at the time when I was 17 and I was a member of the aryan brotherhood. I was also a member of the naacp. The naacp stood against slavery. That was a very clear statement to me.Robert was a good boy and a good man. He was in his late 20s at the time and had become a preacher and writer. He liked music in particular. He was a very good songwriter as well. He would sing and write about issues of religion and things like that. It seemed that his life was a very special one.One of the first people I met at the aa meeting was the black poet and singer bill o'connell, who had just left his home in california. O'connell was a great jaz...
171|We're a small company and there are a lot of people who don't have the opportunity to work in the field of software engineering. So i've been talking to a couple of the smaller teams and they've been trying to figure out what are the best practices to adopt. What they want to do is give back and we have what we need to be able to do so that we can make those improvements a reality.Now we're working with a couple of startups that we're already working on, they're starting to see the benefits for us as a company. We've got to make sure we are taking every last drop. And they're doing that because they're very confident that we will work with them on a project that they're excited about, which has a great opportunity to develop our whole ecosystem of features.So this is what I mean by working with them. They're willing to help out.It is what we're doing.So we're working on a little bit.I'll just touch on the part where you mentioned two years ago that there were two versions of google chrome for android. So we've been working on one version for a while. I talked about google chrome 2.0 for a bit and we started developing it and that's when we saw that some people were seeing it for android and some people were seeing the android version of it very early on. Now we've got google chrome 2.0 and it turn...
172|That's a story that's going on in my head right now.I love you. I love you a lot. I love you just like I love you.You say that you're in love with a child. Tell me more. Is that really true?Well, I don't really have any of that. I have no relationship with it. So I'm just in love with you.Now this is what i've been talking about. That's how I started out in school.Why did you choose to become a nurse?My mom was kind of just a little bit of your typical "I want to be a nurse" Type of person. She was kind of like you. She was a little bit like my dad. She was just so very, very sensitive and kind of tough. Her voice was great. Her voice was wonderful. She also had a really good sense. Like, when I was little I was very sensitive. When I got good grades at her school I was like, "Where is that going to go? Why was she such a fan? Why was she such a favorite child? How could this happen?" I just needed to be a little bit more like her.Is it something that she could've done differently?Oh. You know, all of these weird little things can go wrong. You know, if you get too close to someone you can get some bad luck...
173|one year back I was working with a small, well behaved, and very smart woman who had recently graduated university and wanted to become a therapist. Well, her husband got a job with a private firm and she was looking for a therapist that was in the u.S. She did some research on psychologists and eventually found a group on the internet. This little lady started talking to me about what she did to help people, and it got really bad. She told me she had been working on her husband for years, and she'd been in trouble with her husband. And she told me that she'd been in debt to her husband for years. And she told me, she's just a very nice person, she never thought she'd ever lose her job due to these problems.So I was at a loss. I said, "What the hell is wrong with you?" She said, "Look, I think it's just that you've just been so successful in therapy. You've put in so much, you're getting to where you want to go, and you're going to be okay." Well, this woman was just completely amazing about her experiences. She said, "Well, what can I do for you?" And I said, "I love what you do. I love that you talk about how well you're doing… but what you can do for yourself is really hard to do. You need to work on yourself. You need to be strong...
174|Our mother-in-law was a very bad teacher. I was at work and she'd teach me how to read. I'd tell her I wanted to be great, then I'd put up with her and watch her make me look like an idiot. My mother would tell me later, 'oh, my gosh, those girls had it coming! I was already such an idiot!' They were really bad teachers. She was a very good teacher. I remember my mother telling me, 'you need to go to the school and teach us.' They couldn't teach me anything. She didn't have the guts to do that, so everything came out as horrible. The rest of us were never taught any problem. We were taught to be a little bit better, to think twice about things that are going on in our lives.When you're young, you learn that you could be great. Well, it's hard to do that, because you go through the same life changes as many other people. There's a lot of psychological development that comes with it, which can become very dangerous. For example, I'm in very good physical shape. All my bad habits, I'm very, very bad.What does a good teacher do?A good teacher's job is to make sure they're smart and good at what they're doing. It's not a game with the teachers. It's a big problem when they want to be more or less successfu...
175|imagine, or not imagine, if you were a human being. If someone is standing in front of you and saying that you are going to die. The second you look at that person and think, "That is really awful, isn't it?" Then you know that you are really a human being. And that's what this is about.This is not about human beings, or about humanity at large. This is about all human beings that are affected by mental illness, and how they relate to mental illness. Every human being deserves to be cared for. Every human being deserves to be treated humanely, and it's our job to provide them with the best chance of survival.Now, some of you may have noticed a phrase that comes to my mind. There is this notion that if I had the power to make life better for all humans, I would become the greatest human being. I would take over the world, and I would help improve it for everyone. Now, this is not to say that this would be easy. But I would be absolutely ruthless when it came to making life better for every human being.I would be the greatest human being in the world. That is, to the extent that I can do it.No human being would consider life better for everybody. No human life would consider life better for a person. No human life would consider life better for a planet. No human life would consider life better for ...
176|If you have a story that I wrote where I had a big vision for myself, where I felt I wanted to work more deeply and to put out more books with greater success and greater success, and that I want people to read it and that I wanted their children to read it and that I wanted some of these things to come out. If you know those things, and it's very important to you, to know that there have been very important books for you and that they will continue to be written when they're out, you will know it.I think it's important for you to make your own decision and decide what is your own plan for your lifetime, and you will need to have a sense about how you think your journey will unfold, how much impact you'll make in the rest of your life, and how much impact you think your life will have on your own lives.That is a whole different conversation from what we're talking about today with the people who are writing about "What if" For the last 10 years?When this conversation was about "What if?" In the 90s, I was writing a book about three people who died in three different ways. I was writing about the people who died on their own, those people who had a story and were inspired by it, a big-picture story that was about a great american hero and about a great american tragedy.I was writing about people who had lost so many youn...
177|A few years back my wife and I had worked hard at making our own food. We took pride in our work with us and loved it so much. It's not going to be easy, but we got this perfect recipe for one of our friends. A little help with that, we made a huge mistake.We made a little mistake, but the mistake was to try with this recipe. We did some quick thinking about what to make it with. We figured if we could make it with just half of our ingredients, we wouldn't need to worry too much about the rest. What you can do is double the recipe size and double the recipe size as well.This is our recipe for a big batch of chili powder and just to add a little more spice, I added 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce. It is amazing when you add a great pinch of salt and garlic to it too.The following recipe was inspired in part by the recipe above that I made in our little kitchen aid kitchen.Chili powder and worcestershirechili powder and worcestershire 2 cups water1 cup salt1 tablespoon worcestershire1 tablespoon worcestershire1 tablespoon worcestershire1 tablespoon worcestershirechili powder and worcestershire 1 tablespoon worcestershire sauce3 tbsp worcester...
178|This is a movie about a guy named joe. He's an all-around great guy who is a good man - but there's something about him that I can't put my finger on. It doesn't belong in anybody's head! But i've seen, i've come close, but i've never seen anything like this, right?""What do you mean? That, you know, like, some bad dude?" "I don't think joe really understands the character, does he? He's kind of like you. But how do you know about him? You mean, he's a good guy? Why did he go into hiding because that was the way things used to be in the '60s?"Hannibal is the film's only two central character characters. Though his story takes place in a fictional time, it's clear that it wasn't really based on any genuine love-with-babe, that he is only an alcoholic, or that he would become too young to date. And when hannibal was introduced as the most intriguing character on screen, fans quickly went nuts, as we've seen, for his character arc in some trailers and in the trailers of other show shows and even in the first season's episodes.So what's next? Hannibal's season premiere is being released on november 17, just in time for the very start of 2015's summer vacation, which takes place in the very beginning of the summe...
179|in the late 1980s, a group of young men had started going to work in the grocery store. They saw that there were too many customers when they looked up and there wasn't enough food. And so they decided to go into the store and figure out how to get to the best place for the best part of the next few months.They found a great combination of ingredients that had been found at a small grocery store. All of them were high quality, locally made with the best ingredients. So, the company got to work.In the early '90s, the grocery store business started to gain ground. The company began to grow into two stores. So in the '90s, you have more stores there now than ever. That's what you got.So these four guys in their 40s are going to the grocery store and they're going to buy something that's good for them. Their goal is to do it for them, be it a good food, or even a good friend.But what will the three of them get from this? They're going to buy a piece of chicken, their friends are going to buy a piece of bread, and so on. All of this is going to make money. Now, it seems like this guy's going to be the best food he's ever eaten.So they're going to try and get their hands on something from this, and then they just move o...

181|I was sitting in your office, and I was telling you everything about my life from an early age and the way I'm going to live. I started to write this story because I was depressed about my life, the way I was doing things at that time, and I knew where I needed to go and I knew what it would be like to go to the top of the business. I was working for my dad's startup, and I was still working for him for two years, and I just wanted to be able to go home to my mom and my mom and my kids. I was happy that my parents were okay. I just wanted to make something and to see my father on one of the top boards, and to know that they were right up there where I was going to be able to get to do it. And then, just a few years ago, I got really lucky. I got an internship at google and I got a job with google, and I got to work with a few things. And it just went very well. So I started to do my studies and my phd and my dissertation because I was really excited about the things that I wanted to do with my life and what it was like to be on this board that I was on.And then in about four months I had to leave the company. I couldn't stay for very long. And that is what really broke my heart. But now, I know that I love how it feels...
182|Let me tell you a story about my mother, who was the wife of her ex-husband, a nazi war criminal, and her mother's best friend, an american agent who played the part of an american spy and a nazi spy. So, it just started.There was a story that started in 1941. When my mother came off the nazi war criminal run, she told her family who was in berlin as a british officer of the first navy. My mother told them that her mother was the head of that unit, and that my mother's father was hitler's agent. My mother told my friends, my husband, that my father was a nazi war criminal and the head of the nazi ss. She was the head of the nazi unit. And so the story of my mother was, as I walked down the street, as I ran towards the reichstag, with my men, I was just talking to a couple of us who were in the building, and my brother, the commander of the battalion in the center of the building, and the men, I felt my blood boil, and there was a man who went up to me and said, "What a beautiful woman you are! The one who said she would never stand in the ranks of nazi germany!" And I was laughing in disbelief.I went down to our place of business, and there was this guy. He had never seen my mother go into the company. It was just in the middle o...
183|I met a guy who was in a club called jocks. He had a nice club in his room. He was a big man with a big body, like a golf buddy. I said, "Okay, let's move out of here to be with you." "Okay, let's move to the club." He told us that he had a girlfriend named jill. He called me and asked me to see the girl. I went to her apartment and I told the girl, "You need some help. I'm an older guy. Do you know where I can get some help?" I said, "I know where." "Okay, if I can help you, what would you like to do for me?" She said, "I like to be with you." He said, "I want to be with you two." I said, "You can get me some new clothes and a car and I'lllet you drive me to the club." He said, "You want to join my team? I can get you that. Go to the club and go play football for a week and then you can go to your team and be with me." He said, "We're the one in the club, so I'llget you my old car and the rest can be yours. I can help you." "I really need that. I'm not getting any help from you or anything like that," She said. He said, "I'm a little disappointed. It'...
184|I got a call from a man who got me a little late… and now I want to do something for my wife and me.""Oh no. Oh no. Oh no it doesn't matter which," Said he. "I'm gonna go to my old house where I was born, and I'm gonna do something for my wife. I'll find her and she'll go and tell me it's all fine, but then it doesn't matter what I do. I can go and I'm gonna get to her and I'llmake something for her, and I can do what I want to do, and that's all fine. But now I'm just asking you a question: what do you think?""I'm gonna go find her," Said he. "I'm a big fan of the movie, I just wanted to make something cool. But I think there's going to be some backlash, and I think it's going to be a lot of people angry, and I think it's going to be a lot of people who are gonna like it. So I'm gonna say, 'i'll make something for her and I'm gonna go into the attic and have my wife and me, and my kids get together and I can go buy food, and I can buy things, and I'llgo for a walk and I'lldo something and she's going to go, 'it's your house, man!' ""Oh no...
185|A couple years back, I was doing my first job in a big restaurant and was making so many different things. We were on a long trip and were spending some time together. I walked out with a pair of socks and some jeans and a pair of shoes. It was pretty much our only evening together but I remember a lot of things that happened, not really anything else because I was just so focused on getting something out of it. The next morning, I was in your living room and all of a sudden, I started looking around. And there you go. At the end of the day, we all look at each other.What would you say you think about the fact that you became so focused on your job and didn't think about how you might be able to do anything about it?It seems like we have this whole idea that we have so many opportunities. I think this one is really obvious. The one thing that I don't take very seriously is how our family is feeling and that's a really big part of what we do. What makes a family is how we're made from the same place. You just want to be your best and have the best of everything. I think when we're not focused and not thinking about life like we are, it's important to have the things we need.When you're doing the work of a family member, the whole idea of living in your own home and being able to work with so man...
186|My parents were not living in this part of the world and they'd taken the time to go through the process of becoming parents. My mom was a bit of a baby mama. I can remember my mother telling me, "If you want to start your own business, you have to make a commitment that you want your business to be successful." That's how it started, my parents saying, "You can't just take your daughter out and be dependent on her for jobs, like, you have the right to say no to work, no matter what you have to do."I was raised with a system where, in my case, I was supposed to go off and stay in the neighborhood during certain times of the year and then when I got home I would come back and go to work. And I wasn't always able to do that because we always had that system with us. So, I'm a good kid, but if you want to become a billionaire or just start a business, you've got to learn how to work in a way that works for your family.So, it's important for you to be able to do what you're doing, because it's so hard being dependent on your child. I also think there are good things about being married to a billionaire, because if you're dependent on someone's child, and this is the kind of relationship that you think is best for your children, then it's very important that they learn the righ...
187|This is the day…the first of the three days of the year when we were to go to the white house, it was the same year when mr. Reagan, who was running against me, was going to be inaugurated."I had a feeling I couldn't get through this year unless I stayed up for 30 or 40 minutes at a time, because I knew I wasn't going to come out of this year, so I went to the white house, I saw a message that said 'you have the money to take care of your family. You have the money to make your family happy. You have the money to live your life, and it's not going to change in 20 years.'"At 9:15, mr. Reagan walked back in the oval office into the white house and handed a copy to the president and mrs. Clinton."He read it, and we got a message from him that said 'mr. Reagan, it is with great pleasure that you are going to be president, and I want you to know that we have a great deal of strength in this room, because we've always had a great deal of strength and I want you to know that we have that strength and that our country is going to be strong, and that we will do everything possible to stop this war from ever happening again. I can tell you that that message was relayed to my daughter by a small group of people who were there in th...
188|It's a story I know I will be telling for the rest of my life.""I don't know if you didn't see me in 'the godfather' when you were in high school. I know that's the story. It's hard because we're not family members now. In 'barry' one day one girl said it about how great it was. Then she had an experience that gave her a little insight into what life was like for the young people who were on the streets of detroit, and then she left home and made her way back to america. All I know for sure is that she went through a pretty horrific time that she didn't go to college. But as a young woman she went through an incredible transformation."Sarina is a mother of three daughters. She was living in detroit when her boyfriend, john geddes, began renting out a house at 2575 e. Michigan ave. In 2011. After john and linda lived there for almost a year and a half, a couple of years after they got married, sarina and linda moved into a family unit in grand rapids. They moved into a large apartment next door to their building on 15th avenue, located on a block across the street from john geddes' building in grand rapids. In a moment of clarity, linda looked over at her husband. They shared a single bed and three cars, but john continued to drive. Then linda started driving too. Joh...
189|A friend at some bar decided to make a drink for me because I did something for him. Apparently, when I took a break, my friend was drinking. When things came to a head, I asked him how he was doing. He said he was fine but that he was very busy and in a hurry. It was funny!So, he came to me and said that I should come. I asked if I could come. But his hand came out. He said, "Well, let me come and pick you up. You will stay in a hotel for a while, then you will go to work. It may be a few hours, but I will come." So he came to me and bought me a nice chair for five thousand rushers.Now I have learned all about the secret of getting rich by drinking. Not only do you get more money out of drinking than you would if you had drunk five thousand rushers, but there is very little you can do to get more.So if you get any money out of drinking, you are likely to get screwed by it. It is a good rule of thumb when you get rich that you should have enough to buy a new piece of furniture or to drive a car, or buy a house, or to get some other important activity. If you get a house you will probably have some other things to buy. However, do not get any money out of drunk people. It makes yo...
190|we first met in 1991 when the man who had been taking the pictures was the local priest who had been in charge of organizing some sort of sunday service. The man, who was originally from france, had just completed a mission to america and had been visiting rome in search of the gospel. He had just come there to pray at the gassendi in rome. And he had been trying to find a piece of the new testament and had to get it translated into english. That was one of the first things that happened to him. He came in this taxi to get the translation and he started talking. He just stopped and started yelling. And as we were going through the story of a man who had found nothing to read and had found it, I said to him, you know, "You need to go and read the new testament." I said to him, you're going to need to do that. And all of a sudden this came into his mind. That was the beginning of what happened.The vatican, in the beginning, was a relatively conservative country. They had no rules or regulations on religious freedom. They had no rules on the law to make sure that people were exercising their liberty. And this was not just a matter of the law, of that in particular, as it turned out.So that's what led to his decision. This priest had been working by himself, in an abandoned office in the vatican as well as in this vatican buildin...
191|I got out of an old house in chicago and a friend told me, "A former high school coach wants my advice. He says he doesn't recommend that you go to a job where you have to win. But don't think of it as a job where you can win. Instead, you must go over to the best job you can get." For me, I went to the big jobs. I lost my whole family.I was able to go back to my family. I have three kids, but I haven't been able to go back to the family for four years. It's been crazy. I had people tell me we could not go to work, but that it's only because they can't. I don't want to go.The first time my husband had to deal with what he saw as a man who would make a poor life, he told me, "You have to be kind of self-reliant, so you can go back to home. That's the first time you know that you're never going to be able to do it."He's in jail now in illinois, so it was his problem. His wife was not being nice to him. He was saying, "But not this time," Which was an insult.But that was before he started dating. He has to go back to his family because he can't go back to his family.It's sad but you know, we hav...
192|i saw that the old man in the bar was still trying to tell his story. It was so old man in that bar. He had to tell his story to get his business back up. That was our way of saying that he was trying to sell to the other bartender who was working to keep it going. So he took a call. He'd said, 'hey look, if you're going to sell your business you have to sell it to the other customer.' He said, 'you're not gonna sell it to my customer. You're gonna sell it to the other customer,' so I called him. He said, 'i understand what you're saying,' but he couldn't do the job. He couldn't do the job. He didn't have the money for us to do it and I was just trying to get my business back up. I was trying to sell my business to the other customer. And he just said to me, 'you know what, that customer wasn't selling it to me. I don't know how he got that number of customers.' I asked the guy who is making the numbers on that phone from his account and he responded, 'yeah. He did get 10 customers last night.' I just said, 'i understand.'When this man went to work, we got $200 in our pockets.When the day when I started working, I got $200 in my pocket.We got that money al...
193|when I was a kid my father took me to my parents on my way to college. When I was a little kid I went to a local hospital. I went to the hospital and the nurse was talking to me, trying to calm me down. A nurse was trying to tell me that my blood was red. I was like "Whoa, that's crazy." She was like "Don't you feel like I'm here. Just stay away from me." And I just took it. I'm like "Wait, wait, wait." Just keep away from me, okay? So I left my parents, went to college, went to middle school, went to a lot of different schools, came in and I was really accepted.They never mentioned anything about how they thought the blood would have been so different. They only talked about it. It wasn't until they found out that I had leukemia and couldn't breathe normally — which it was — that I came back and lived, just like everything else, for six years.So at first, I didn't know what was going on. Then I started to see that I wasn't really a problem all that much, because I was healthy, I had a good job, I was doing well and I was doing well. I knew it was normal, I was well-adjusted, I was learning, so I got on really well and I was doing pretty good — and then I thought, "I hop...
194|Every time I get a new email from your company in india, I just ask: "How do you feel about this?" I reply: "I am glad you asked." I get a few compliments and then a few email messages. I like that.It's the only way I can tell you how happy my job is.I was once a huge salesman at facebook. A friend gave me a small business phone and the one I kept at my house for the last 20 years. I took that to facebook which turned me into a great person and a big deal. The next day I told other people like this. I went and showed them the business phone and they didn't like it. They didn't like the idea of selling on them.For a while I wanted to buy a business phone and I thought it would be great, not only for my own business but for the family because they were my friends and so I could use them in my business. And they agreed so I went to facebook to find them.I wanted to buy a business phone from facebook and from where? The place. I called for a minute and the man was like: "Hello, are you there? I have a business phone for you so why not check your mobile number and I will get you a copy."Then he asked me if I wanted to buy an iphone 6 and I said yes. He did not know that I was in india, and thi...
195|A girl was trying to tell me something when she got home. I said, "Tell your story!" And she started crying. She kept talking.I remember saying, "You'll help me get my hand up, too!" And I'm like, "You gotta help me get up! I can't do this." And she was crying. She was crying for the first time in my life a few hours ago. And then I just said, "I'm a hero of yours and you'll like me to get up."But then she started crying again and again. I was like, "Is that what you got up for?" And then I said, "No." So she's happy that I'm not trying to do it. I know my mom's going to get mad if she hears this now.My dad's not really out at all. He's not even around anymore.I always tell him he's going to be my best friend later in life, but he has to put the pressure on me to start having my own way with him. He's like, "Let's make this work. I'll be good with you." And I think that's how he's going to get me out of my depression.I want you to read my full account of me that I just published, and that's when I got the call from your father, who's the best guy i've ever met. He came ove...
196|Just a simple moment ago the news broke about our father being shot a very large amount of time. He was shot in the stomach. It was immediately taken by a medical professional, who was very quick to call out to the scene."So what is your reaction, my dad?""I don't know. That's when I took it personally."It wasn't long now. The medical expert confirmed that he had been shot for almost one year. But there was no way for him to know why his father was being shot so quickly. That was why, his father had been killed."You want me to tell you something, my dad."He was suddenly unable to do anything. His blood was boiling with heat."I'll give it to you, my dad. It's nothing special."That made him go and give the medical professional's gun to the family members as well as a little bit of medicine.Then his father, who did not want to say anything, told him to relax and go and take care of the matter."We'll give you as long as it's not too much trouble. I'll get you some things. The gun and all my stuff was the only thing left."That was the only thing that his father wanted to say. He had not seen his father when he was killed. He had not seen his father when he was buried...

198|in january 2010, there was a man walking in the driveway of a house where he owned a gun. The neighborhood kids were asleep asleep when he noticed them. Then a cop pulled up his car and they got out. We had just caught a speeding car. He picked up the gun, pointed it at the car and took a magazine. He also shot the car's brakes. The police said it was because he had a fake gun like that, and that he didn't shoot the car.At that point, a police officer was there, and when he saw a woman walking by on the sidewalk, the guy took the magazine from her and opened it up and pointed it at the woman. The cop shot her six times.The cops were all on the edge of panic, all this time. They thought they were going to get caught and they would call to tell the authorities. They were not. The guy got out and fired at them all.The cops were stunned at how serious that was. The woman ran through the street and got into the car. The cop fired three more shots. The woman was hit in the stomach. The woman ran to the kitchen, where there was a doctor and went to the police for help.Two police officers took her to her car where they shot her in the eye. The man got out and took the magazine. The police said he shot the woman in the hip. The judge denied it. The...
199|you know, I used to be very proud of the u.N. For being in a better place. And I think the u.N. Is a great place. And it's in a new location. And that, right? That's what we've done. We've done the greatest job in our history, because I think when you take a step back and look at the united nations, it's an international organization. It's a powerful community. And we do good work. And we don't allow our politicians to do what we're doing.Amy goodman: how did you first hear of the u.N.?Juan gonzález: well, I mean, I think the first thing we did was we got a lot of people to speak about the issue, and for a lot of people to speak about the issue, and it brought me to the united nations. And I think, again, if I'm right, the first thing we did was ask the united nations to review u.N. Resolutions and make recommendations on how we can best work together, and so much more.It's a good thing because, I mean, we're in the middle of a massive humanitarian crisis, and as a people, we're a very, very, very sensitive group. So, it was great to have this opportunity to be part of this project, and that was fun. And in our view, tha...
200|the first thing I think you should know is that my name is matt, my name is josh, and I'm a professional boxer called tomahawk. I've been training on top of boxing since 2011, and my family is very strict. Their goal is to get me out of the house and into the ring.A few years ago I was in toronto and was looking for some time to ring with a couple of my friends. The first thing I did was go to a hotel to get in touch for them. It was a long night in toronto at one of the big arenas where you could see the crowd and the promoters. When I said, "Yeah, come over here to work," They let me in. I went back to the hotel with them and they asked me a question that I didn't know and they asked me questions I didn't know.I would sit in a room with our coach tomahawk that night and we talked for an hour about what kind of fighters were available if we were ever going to fight in toronto again.I'd heard some things about people from my training center telling people that boxing hadn't changed that much in the past. I thought, "I'm going to never get a chance to make that conversation with a guy who was very hard to find." That really was my perception at the time and I don't think I would have ever got that kind of response.I was really happy t...

202|when you were 18 and you were playing basketball.It came to an end when I got a scholarship I had to transfer.When you were 23, you played basketball in england.You didn't even know what was going on then in england until you were 20.By the time you were 27, you got a scholarship to play basketball in a major league.When you were 28, you got a scholarship to play baseball.In addition to playing baseball, you got a bunch of other things on the line from other countries when you were 20.How did you learn?We played baseball for a while. In high school you had to learn a lot in high school.You would go to a sports bar, but you would also go to a baseball team for a while.You didn't really get to that point until college.When you graduated from high school, you had a lot of experience.In your career, you played all your games.You didn't play very much basketball or baseball or soccer.You played football at one point.You did one little game in high school.There was some play in soccer.You played football for a while.You didn't really play as a hitter until you got your first taste of the big leagues.Well, if you played baseball or basketball an...
203|at a party in new york, we were taking our pictures. We got together to film it, and it came out, the first picture in a year. It wasn't really until people saw it with their friends that we realized it had to be a one-shot. We looked at the video, and as a couple of months later we put it up in the internet.So the idea was, if we just went to a restaurant and got these really good photos of us, we could just go into a party and shoot it together, right? And if you really dig what this thing was that you wanted to photograph, like having a big party and then talking to these strangers, then you might think, "How will I get a lot of pictures?" And I think, "Well, maybe I can make a lot of them, but I don't want to take them all up."We didn't come up with the concept of "Making of" Or "Making of a movie." It was just, "I want to make something that people think will be exciting and fun. I want to look cool on the big screen." Well that was something that we really had to figure out from the photos.So, from there, we shot two things.The first time, when I was making "All of us" At the time, we made it into our film. And then we got some very, very lucky friends. Yo...
204|my friend and I worked on the same project, and it was so easy. My friends and I had a good time. We'd already done our thing. She was really cool. We'd already made the entire thing. She showed up at the door and said, "I can't wait to get started."We went to the office, talked, and eventually got to some of the new things. She started talking about how great this project was and how great it was for our company. We were so blown away that we started making this, saying, "This will be a really big deal." We were so excited. I've been doing this on our company for 10 years, and I just said, "You know, this is very exciting for us." We didn't know who was coming to our office. I had to make a decision about what to do based on her. It was really, really big.She mentioned the idea a couple of times before, and she said, "I'm going to do this for 20 people. This job is going to be very exciting for all of us." We were like, "Oh, right." We were excited. Then we had a conversation in the office, and I said, "Oh, I'lldo it." I had to have someone there. We were a team. So, I have to say, this is one of the most exciting, amazing things I have ever done...
205|This was my first time doing research in the world of social networking. I discovered that when people post photos, they often think about what's going on, and they have no idea what's going on other than social networking sites. So, you know, I'm just trying to be a good friend to people that do social networking…and that's sort of where you're able to connect really well, not just as an individual, but as a company which you can make money from and I'm just glad that you brought this to my attention. I'm just trying to be in this position where people can connect to me and I can be part of the community. It happens to be a good feeling right?I'm just proud of how much my efforts and my network has made me really well-connected. I'm just proud of my work as a company, I just can't wait to share it with people who might not be able to hear it. I'm not here to take selfies, I'm here to show someone that it's there, and I'm not going to take pictures. I just want people who are looking for something to connect. So, it's just great that it's like, 'hey, there's a little project out there that I can help you with. How about you help me make money by taking a picture of something or a quote from your favorite website?' So, we can really make a difference here – and also, ...
206|I'm in a room with my family and when a kid comes down the street, I'llsay, 'oh my god, my god, he just shot me!' And my dad and my mom and I thought it was my fault because we were just waiting for him to walk by us all the time.The second time, my mom and I were talking to their dog. This guy just got up and shot me. He took out his hand and he shot my dad. I don't remember what it was that was done, but it was like, 'oh my god. This is what happened to you!' But I didn't get to see his face for awhile because then he would come around my room and shoot the kids in my dad's yard and he would shoot me.We did something called the second shot. I'm like, 'what's the difference between that and the first shot?' I'm like, 'how does the second shot work? What's the difference?' I think I think I got out of hand because I didn't have a gun. They said, 'well, you can't take any shots.' I had a gun when I was 12 or 13. When I got 12 or 13, my mom and I were like: 'that's ridiculous!' It was like there really weren't any guns for us.I remember one kid I was just with was my mom and my friend. We had this man walking by who wa...
207|On april 15, 2001, my father walked by and saw the bus that had just arrived.I was 10 years old. I was sitting in the back seat, holding my seatbelt in my hand, and heard loud and clear. I was a little nervous going in the door. When I pulled the door open, I saw the bus was now in the middle of the street, and the bus stopped at a lot of different locations.My father, a taxi driver, sat at some of the different cars to get his driver's license. He was sitting next to me and had a big expression on his face. He was shaking his head and said, "Well, we don't want to deal with the bus again so we can go on our day and get home."Then, as he got out of the car, he said, "Can I get on the bus?"All I could do was say no.When I got on the bus that day, I did everything right, but it was more about getting home with my family. And I still don't know if everything just went fine. It just didn't. All we had was two hours of driving to the border. You know, after driving five days, I got really nervous.I did everything I was supposed to do, but it wasn't all good. It was a lot of work and I had no motivation whatsoever, so I was just thinking out lou...
208|I was a kid, you know, a kid, we were having a lot of fun at recess. The girls from my high school, who used to be the guys at my high school, they would go on the playground when the kids were older, to take a nap. Everybody was laughing at each other. Like, 'oh, how am I doing, you know?'""You were always playing in the corner. It was almost like the playground."A little boy then called out "Buddy, buddy, buddy!" And they stood there, one of them pulling the other girl out of her way. The next thing you knew, they were in the park."My dad told me, 'she's my friend!' And I said, 'yeah, I'm so glad.' ""He never told anyone I knew, or I never really knew anyone else and then I was like, 'ok.' He didn't want me to feel like I wasn't a hero. I had no idea who he was. I wasn't even a kid."He'd gone to the park just to get some toys or something, like a baseball bat."No, he would tell me 'hey, they've got it! It's gonna cost you $40.'""That's because of my dad, but the last thing I wanted to do was throw a monkey in my face because I was never a kid. ...
209|A couple years back I had an idea I was having with someone. I wanted a character that was about young adult comics and was interested in young adult stories. I had met my friend john, and I just knew that he would be in the comics and had some fun with it. So I went and hired him to write an introduction to one of the other characters I was creating. And the story was so silly, I wasn't able to actually see how that worked out. I don't even have to explain it now because that character is completely overrated. The story didn't want to be overrated or something. I didn't want to have any trouble with it. It didn't feel like it was a huge undertaking.Why was it so difficult to write an introduction to a young adult character?I wasn't really aware of comics at the time, so I was just using whatever comic book I had. I didn't really know what was going on there. John was so into it, and he knew that I was trying to write a story that was about a teenager, who was doing something, but I was trying to tell a young adult story about a superhero and it was one that was being read at such a young age.

And you know, I don't know any of the things that are going on here, but as far as I know, the only thing he's done in this city with the idea that I want it is just gotten away."We've been told that a man who could kill himself in public has been charged with murder. It's been speculated that the man who shot himself was a member of a group affiliated with al qaeda. However, the man who took down a police car last week for being "Too close" To the front seat of a car that officers were using as leverage to stop a car, was not the man driving the car or a member of the group.After a night of chaos in the city, members of the black lives matter movement had planned an armed robbery with a handgun in the hopes that it would force a police car into a crowd of protestors and make the gunman run to a nearby home from a nearby mall.As of press time, the new york city police department had not issued a response to the shooting of the black man.Watch the video of the shooting below, and sign here for the full report...
211|I found myself in the middle of a conversation with about 25 people. One of them had just decided to start making money off of an experience she had with others. Another person, in her 20s, had just graduated from college, so she had started making $20,000 a month. This time, instead of helping someone else, she was helping someone else. She was giving people opportunities so they could have a higher quality of life.Now, I realize I'm not completely alone. I think of myself as a writer, an artist. And I'lltell you this story for you: I am a passionate artist who started writing. My first job was to write about something I felt was important for my community — and my family. So, we decided to work on a couple of novels together to help spread the word. We spent a lot of time writing the books and then we ended up writing both of those books — so we know what we're making. I was fortunate enough to live a year before I met my wife and kids. I have to say, our kids were so close, and so supportive — and it's hard to even describe.It's been a great year for me and my writing. So, I think I owe it to you now for all of those times i've had fun writing. And I want to hear from you and the ones who are struggling. Please let us know you have any questions — and I'llanswer...
212|in the middle of the early 2000s, an oil spill in florida turned into a major international economic disaster, and there is no way to predict how the disaster will spill across the u.S.The next decade or so will be the first of many, if not the most, disasters with massive effects on the economy and the lives of untold numbers of workers.The biggest effects are in the energy sector, where there will be thousands of jobs lost every year. The energy industry is a $12 trillion industry — and the jobs in it will be wiped out by what is known as the clean power plan — which is what will result.The clean power plan is the most important environmental program in u.S. History, and the second of its kind. It set a dangerous temperature cap, put the nation's power grids on alert, and made it possible for thousands of fossil fuel companies to burn off their dirty energy.Today's disasters will be catastrophic for the country, the world, and the planet.It is impossible to know all the facts about the situation until you have been informed by experts, lawyers, the press, and even the best scientists within the oil and gas industry.I would not presume to be able to predict what will happen from the air at a national level.My best guess is that the next big disaster will be a spill from a natural gas well that could cause a massive leak out int...
213|I think about people that come to me and say, "I'm sick of you." I never really thought about that and felt that it was just a personal thing, because I just feel like i've only met three people that i've known before. It's really hard to think about, you know? I don't know what I'm going to write. But when I do, it's kind of like, "This is going to be such a big deal."We are in a transition, and it's been really difficult for many people who have this new mindset. But when you look at what happened last year, when the president had this very big moment for his life, and then it started to turn into this big moment for his family, and then it suddenly became all this sudden, that made it almost the last thing that you would ever want and want to do is bring back a family. People think about me from the standpoint of "I want to have all my kids here."They think, "Well, I love you here," Or "I want to be able to go back to work and have them come back here, and I love you." They think, "Well, I can do that." It really has become more difficult for people, especially the women, and they are starting to see that as a big loss to the family.And when you look at the women of their generation and the number of women who are, th...

215|In a day or two I'm going to be a journalist for a local newspaper. You've got a friend who's a photographer, and you're doing a very interesting piece on him because he's an italian. I've seen him in the italian press and he's very nice, even if he's spanish, as a man. We were hanging out, but after a while we were both looking for his story. It was, like, "Wow. This is really interesting." And he was like "Yeah. This is really interesting." And, like, "Well, I'm not going to do that."And then like a couple of weeks later in late november, we'd had a couple of interviews. One of them was about donald trump, which is an incredible thing to do, because I thought at that time it was just kind of a big surprise to the rest of us, but then I thought, "Oh, wait a minute, the rest of the nation is going to know about it," Because what's being said about him is, as you pointed out, he's a man of a certain kind of temperament, a person who's had a lot of issues over the years and is very open-minded, and he takes care of himself. So I got to the point where I started to feel like, ok, I'm in this, and it's not all about me. I don't want to be this guy talking about somebody who I don'...

218|an entrepreneur who is very good at what he does isn't actually the best at anything and does it with such ease he has no real power over what he does.So, even in the company of someone who is very good at everything, he's still working as he can as fast as he can pull it together and he's still trying to make something good out of it. The problem is that when he gets his hands on it, he is so slow that it's all very easily broken up into small pieces that he has to keep working hard and it takes him a long time to figure out what he needs to do.The other problem is that when we're all in the business of building things, we don't really need a lot of time to get it done. If we're all in the business of building things, there's no need for us to really do much more than focus on getting things done quickly, and when it comes to building things, it's really not very good.This is the problem that I'm talking about. When we've built things for four or five years, we still don't know when it's going to be time to start rebuilding the business. When we've built things for a year, it's like our business is starting to collapse for some reason, as we get better at making things we think we can get better at.And that's exactly what happened to me when I decided to star...
219|During the course of that year, I was a part coach at a national championship game against the university of connecticut, and the team was underdogs. It was a national championship game and my team had to win it out in overtime. I felt like, I didn't belong in that. I'm not getting paid for that type of work. I should make it a little bit easier on myself, and I would love to be one of the top, most talented coaches in the country. I know it's not easy for a lot of coaches and I know it will take some time, but it is the way I'm doing it and I'm going to do it."He did say that for the rest of his life, he felt like the job was something he should stay focused on and that he was just doing it because he wanted to work hard."I was like an athlete, and I was doing the best I could," He said. "For one moment I just wanted to go to school, and I didn't want to try anything other than doing my job and work hard and doing the best I could. But one day, you try to take it on that you're just going to work your ass off and do it your way. You realize that. And you don't want to let things affect you.

220|on a sunday morning of july 14th, 2013, six years after my second death from pancreatic cancer, I was sitting in the living room of my brother's house in little falls, idaho. He had just given up on cancer, which was his first. He was having lunch, had a baby, and I was just going to call out to him and say, "Hey, how are you doing? I have cancer, but I'm very hungry right now. I'm sick."I was crying and I would call him over and say, "You could tell by his voice when you see my brother, he's not getting better, you're really sick. You're a burden. He's not getting better, and he's not getting the help he needs. He's not getting what he needs."He wanted to know what he was feeling and I didn't want to tell this to the world. I said, "Listen, I will say this to you and to everybody in this room and to the world. The world will be watching you tonight. The world will be watching you tonight."That was it.About 45 minutes later, he passed away, and I lost the courage to keep telling him or her that I had cancer. It was a horrible time in my life.I don't want to make another person feel like I'm the sole source of pain. I want to make them feel bad for thi...
221|I have just been driving from oklahoma to the middle of the state and then my truck stops in the middle of the road. I'm driving up to what appears to be the best price that they have ever sold me. So I tell the driver, this is a truck like you can never get anywhere at what price, but they tell me, 'i guess you can pick this up for about $250 to $500 dollars. So this is for the best price. What can you pay for it?' So I tell that driver, this looks like a truck like you could for sale. And he says, 'no, that is very good. You know, this is something that you don't want to pick up. We will take care of it.'"In a phone interview at a town hall meeting last summer, he told the crowd, "When you put the money down, all you want is to get it back on. I'm going to give this up.

222|I was a high schooler with a friend who was just going through a really tough time. When our friend came in after graduation that summer, he was sitting at about 11:30 in the afternoon. And there he was, and he was talking about a girl standing by him and she had a knife in her hand. And as he lay on the ground, she asked him, "What do you mean by knife?" And he just said, "You go in here, you go in here." And he walked back from that spot. That's when we had to call 911.The next day, we got a call from the woman we had just interviewed. She'd been on-duty on the navy ship, and she'd just been shot. And she said she was shot by a group of six other marines. I mean, they were just shooting at the marines that had just put out that rifle.So the guy that was shot by her and the group of six marines was killed in the action. I could tell by the way the guy with the knife was bleeding heavily.I was in the hallway when the girl said, "What happened?" And I said, "I know it's just me. I'm just going to go down there and find out what happened." And she just said, "I don't know." I said, "Oh, what did you just do?" I said, "I go down and find the guy....
223|I was in my 20s, and my parents were dying. Their family had been in prison for 10 years for a murder that never went down. They were very shocked. I wanted to tell my family and everyone in my family that it was terrible. But then I had my family, and my father's mother told me it was just so bad. She just had to get up and go to the hospital, and she had taken a life and put in a lot of work.So I just kept writing to tell my family and my family members that this was the worst thing they could have faced."So I wrote him some letters and told him that he had to do this. I said, 'why don't you write your own stuff?' He said no. He wanted to do it, and I wrote him a letter. I told him his rights are up, and I wrote back that I had to do it."It was very nerve-wracking to write a letter saying this had to be done. And I thought to myself, 'wow, this guy is gonna lose this, and he's gonna lose his family,' and I said, 'don't worry about it. He's just gonna get better.' It would have been a tragedy if it had happened in this country."Now I'm in the hospital now. He was there for five hours, and it was so horrible. He has a really bad fever, an...

I heard people saying, 'he's not good enough,' and then I had to call the police. So I was taken straight out that night."My father's employer, that company, fired him because he was so poor. He didn't have enough money to buy a car and it cost over £20,000 to buy a van. He didn't have the money or the means to pay for it.

225|I'm going to write a story about how, in 2013, my daughter was diagnosed with a severe asthma. She was sitting in the front of a bus carrying her bag, and this lady was sitting in the back of the bus, and I was holding her bag. And I grabbed her. And I said, "Well, I don't know why you're being held at gunpoint in the back of the bus." And I said, "You shouldn't have done that. I think you should have done that. It's not right." And I went through my kids' health records, where she was living. If I had done something wrong, I would be punished. But because of something you do, you want to do something about it. I thought, "You should not do this."Amy goodman: I wish to thank you to the other two judges, the judges representing the plaintiffs, the lawyers for the plaintiffs—and to amy goodman, who is the show's host, who was with us.

So his idea is to put his money in and get to work, the way it should be."She says he would rather you not have a product. "When I say I want to do something, they don't want to say I want to create something. They say 'if you create something, put me in this position and I will create it'. So the idea of 'my idea is to make my business work'. I'll make my business make the world work, if you do what I'm doing, I'lldo my next thing. I think the way it works is that everyone will do that and the customer will pay, but it's a different type of business and no one can ever understand that."With regards to his own business model, smith said: "I always had a dream and then one day I saw a picture of my model that was just perfect – it's me – it's my dad. He's always liked it. He says, 'you know what? These are some kids in the garden, just putting their toys in a bag, making a box of toys and stuff like that.

228|i was a young boy in 1969 when the great white north opened its gates to the world. It was a country with a lot of great cities of almost the size of new york city. I went to school in a small town in the mountains and there would be men and women walking around the streets, saying "Oh boy, it's getting hotter." It was a place that had been around for generations and it was the very first people's country to have large cities. I remember talking with people who said they saw "Oh boy, that's hot."At that time, I thought about trying to be a writer too. But what I didn't realize was that it was possible to write about life. It was like a world without borders. I was afraid of the people I knew. I didn't understand what it was like to be from outside the world. It felt like a dream.One day an old friend of mine went to me in the back seat. She said, "So you're writing for the national?"I said, "What? It's a national story. It's your story. I have a lot of stories that I want to tell. You're trying to figure it out for me, don't take it out of my hands. Take it out of my hands. It doesn't matter what.

229|When I first took off for washington, d.C., I was a little shy. I had a few months off before I left then; by the time I arrived, I knew how much my hair didn't match my height. I was a little more timid than most people. A funny thing happened to me then that day as well.I remember watching the football game with my parents, both from my home town of seattle. When we got back, I was still so pretty and wore a long blond suit. When paul perkins was making the jump into the nfl, he said, "I think that's how I look. If you look at the pictures of my haircut, it looks sort of like a little kid. I'm a little shy for men that are very muscular. But my hair is pretty damn good." The way he looked at me after was pretty much what I wanted. If you look at photos of paul perkins, that is my hair. I can't think of a more typical person in that picture."Pierce wilsonwilson had his own hair, but he was quite handsome. You can tell that by the way he always wore black jeans and a red tank top. He had a long, flowing ponytail that had long been cropped to look like a headstock, short and thin, with a black band around the headline. In the 1980s, wilson was considered the perfect specimen for a show that was going to be broadcast o...

We have no idea how we are going to go down this road.You have no idea what the story is about until now. There is a lot of misinformation about how the band came to be and what the plan was. How did it all go from there?It's all too personal, because when you talk about my wife, the name that makes my wife weep is the one i've always used to call the bride. I never expected her to be the bride. I never expected her to be the most beautiful woman in the world. But on the face of it, I think that was the whole point of the band. We wanted her to be our bride and that's why we started working with her and what we're trying to accomplish here. We don't want to be the kind of guys that have three kids and start laughing at one another. We want to be the rock stars that nobody ever saw us dancing, that all the guys are, and we don't want to be the last one singing us a song. That's what all those girls got to do. You put your foot down and you can only hope.We love the song "Get a girl from the bottom" Because there is so much fun t...
232|My name is mark schmitt and I was born in the chicago area of illinois. As a high school biology teacher, I read some of the best science fiction, fantasy and comic books. When I was younger, I read a few horror anthologies, the first of which was the best-selling collection, a year in the life of arthur conan doyle. I would later read the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy by alan moore and the harry potter series, the first book in the series which dealt with a very real and alien character. However, all of the books were written on the same schedule. So after a few months in the classroom, I was inspired to take the science fiction thing further. As I grew older, both my interests and my desire to learn more about science fiction became more intense. I was in the late '1960s. At that time, science fiction had never been successful at winning awards for science. But after I had done my research, especially in the 1940s, more and more people started to read science fiction. As I read science fiction, I started to think about how much could be learned from it. I was told that there is an enormous amount of material. And, after that, I started to read more and more, reading a lot of books. I started to look at how science fiction has evolved over time. And, I realized that maybe it is because there are fewer novelists and more authors.The author's nam...
233|It's the middle of january and I'm sitting in my office, looking at my laptop, and I see something on my screen. The laptop is called a g2. It's from a laptop that was stolen from an apartment building by a student who wanted to make me pay for the loan. After that, I was given a loan and this is where I lost my g2. It was worth a dollar more to me than when I stole it the day before, so now it's in my name.What's the story like?My story is a bit different than a lot of what you hear. The idea for this story comes from what happened to my g2. This was a pretty big one. I had two g2s stolen from my address. I had to pay for a $300 student loan that was given to me because I had to pay a large surcharge on the loan. I was a victim of student debt for a long time, and I was in debt all those years. I had to pay for my high school. What did I do? I had to go to a bank and get my loan, because I had to pay a small deposit on the loan. I had to pay the entire $300 loan. I also had to make sure that nothing else went into my account, because I had to go back to the bank with all the details we'd put in the account. Then I had to take back the entire money...

He spoke carefully to his friend, "You know, I didn't want you thinking that I could be your teacher. I thought it would be nice to be able to be someone your friends were. However, I was really just looking to see how you were feeling when you were a child. I really didn't want you to feel bad. I wanted to be loved, if only for the time being. It was just a matter of how I felt with myself and you in mind. I have no intention of ever falling in love with you again, nor would I ever do anything like that again.""You can be your teacher." I nodded."No, no, I can be it. I'm not your teacher, and I will never hurt you or make you feel bad, either." His hand rested against mine, "I'll teach you what love means to you. I will give you everything you can handle to be as happy as you can be with someone you love. I will tell you about yourself, to you how you feel and I'llshow you how you can do just that.""Alright, so you're going to be a good person, your friend." I said with a smile that only he could understand. That smile didn't feel like him doing it....
235|When I was twenty-four, a friend of mine from a very well-placed religious and political family had recently gone to new york and said to me, "What are you doing here?" I said, "Well, my brother, it's a really weird place, it's a place like that, but you should be comfortable in it."I said, "Well, I understand he might be uncomfortable with it all. But you know what, if what I'm saying is true, then it's something I'm sure he wouldn't be comfortable with." So he wrote a letter to me, saying that he had to leave new york because he couldn't afford to pay a living wage. He was about to leave the city for canada.He had no money to go to new york to study, so he went to my office in new york.He started going to our office on the corner of 16th street and 15th street, and told me he didn't think they would let him work that day, so he kept coming back and said, "What about your office? You know, I can't get you to let me go, but I gotta go to your house." I said, "No. I don't have to leave my room." He kept coming back and I didn't leave my room. I went out to a restaurant and I sat at a table with him and then I looked at the map and I said, "O...
236|I started out as a journalist when I was 16. I started out as a journalist. My family was a young couple. My father was the director of the company that I worked for. I had a good relationship with him. We went to a little movie festival that I attended. And all of a sudden the festival went to the top of my school list. And I was going to be at the top of my class. And I made that huge mistake – when I started doing this project with a young adult in my age group. And then I just sort of let it all out. And then, because there was no other option, I was just stuck with this kid and his family. And that was my first experience with real real journalism.And then, the next year, my family was all over the world talking about it. And that was a really long time ago. And then after that, everybody started talking about it. And it was something that really made me realize that I needed to get out there and do it right. I needed to get out there and do it right.As a reporter, I think you all have a responsibility in life. You do that. And I think the whole story is that I was so fortunate that I was able to do so much. I think it's important for anyone who's ever been through a terrible experience to be able to give that kind of perspective. And the only job I can do as a reporter i...
237|i'm an 18 year old who likes to read. I was born in california to a single mother and a single father. As far as I know, two of my best friends live in a small community in california. They've lived here many times and have all moved here.I was born and raised here, california. We're surrounded by a lot of beautiful scenery. It's beautiful when we can't help but move. It's wonderful when we realize the beauty of it all.What's that feeling, how do you manage it, what do you say that you're saying?It's not a problem to me. It was my mother calling, saying her name, and I was like, that's my story.Well, I heard it was my mom calling, but she wasn't a good person. And she didn't want us to hear about it.What does that feel like, what does that feel like to you?In the morning there's a little noise. I hear this beautiful melody, "Hey, here's this girl", and I turn around.You know, I have a bad feeling because it's the first time. I see this beautiful melody and that's why i've started reading it.The melody starts: "I'm on the road. I'm going to the airport. I'm going home to my dad." Or, "I'm going to see yo...
238|i came back with a group that was trying to help an elderly man who had been beaten up. I saw a young black man who was wearing my jacket. They came and helped him out. They were able to turn the table so that my partner could come and help someone who had been beaten up. I had not been able to find any of their support or anyone at their door. Their support was not there. It was just like, they were kind of taking their turn and they were getting help or saying, hey, I'm coming to see you. This is what they want. Well, i've got to tell you, that's not the kind of situation that happens. I feel like I'm being told a lie and that's not good. You're being told lies so don't tell me anything. Because I'm just not a person who's going to tell you anything. You will not feel good about it. You know, I wouldn't say that.Amy goodman: in the video you're saying, "My friend's going to come and help me out." Are you talking about how he was beaten up by other young black people or are you saying, "I got him beaten up by black people? Because you put him in the hospital with a broken arm. You took him there with bruises on his arms and leg and told him he had to go to jail for 12 months," You saying, "I have to tell you now." ...
239|I want to tell you a story. A guy came home and asked me what happened to the dog. I told him for the cat. It's a pretty big dog. He was getting into the house, I thought, how did he know that I didn't have the cat? He said, 'oh, it's fine. I'm a cat lover. I just wanted to know.' I said, 'well, this is a dog that's been gone for a couple of years.' He said, 'well, what is your dog doing here?' "After a few days of waiting for a dog to be found, the humane association sent her to the home, which is now occupied by a pet breeder.Peta and other animal rights groups have long insisted that all dogs are created equal and that any new laws that seek to ban them should be challenged.In a letter sent in february, the american association of retarded dogs called the new law "A radical move" That would "Put the right-to-kill community back in the spotlight," Calling it a "Disruptive move toward the end of the era of pet euthanasia.""This is an appalling act by the anti-pest industry," Said mark bledsoe, a national spokesman for the nonprofit. "This is the first time that the u.S. Supreme court is taking such a stand to end dog bans."The american humane association...
240|one time, I was watching, reading, discussing, writing some work. I heard an old-timer tell me about a fellow from new york. He was tall, white, and in his late twenties, he had just graduated from high school, but one day an old woman approached him and asked, "Where did you get your hair?""Just one week ago," I said. "I had it on in college. I'd like to do some hair research, but there's a guy with a beard that we don't know about because I don't want to get in on the ground floor.""Ok," The old lady said, "Let me try to teach you a lot about your hair. He'll get my ideas. I'll put one back on so I can take it off." She handed it back to me."Then let's go back to our topic," I said. "We don't want to know about the guy's beard. You've got a story with an old lady in the street. I'd have to tell you a story about her for him to know about. I know he has a beard."She smiled, then shook her head a little."Well, let's talk about the new guy," I said. "I'm an old person, in my late twenties, so I just came out of college on the first day of my new job. My father called me an...
241|i was a young kid. I wasn't really an athlete. I didn't have a lot of athletic ability. I took part in the team bus. I was a rookie in high school, I was a sophomore in high school, I played in high school in high school. But then, one day I met an older guy. He seemed like a really smart guy who was doing a lot of things that would help you in any sport. A lot of things. He was the kind of person you would spend a lot of time with on your own, working towards your goals.And that was the kind of person you wanted. And like you say, you didn't realize it. And that was how you got to know me. So it's all about you. I'll tell you this story. I was playing basketball last year for the miami heat's team. I was in high school, I was a freshman in high school. I'd been practicing for two years. I was just playing at my school in high school in miami. And I found out that there were people that were working at my school. So I asked them to call me. And they called me again. I was just in awe of these people who were working there. And I was like, 'holy heck, this guy is going to be so good.'And then, you know, just like I was when I was going to high school, I was like, 'hol...
242|I've been talking with some friends who are in college and they're starting to tell me the same thing about how they had a friend who was very nice. Then one day I got a text from his dad saying he loved his uncle and he gave it to him, but he was out of town and his dad had no clue about how to handle things. So I wanted to know how he handled his family, and I wanted to know what kind of person he was going to be if he died.Beck raddatz: I understand that. I'm sorry, but this isn't the way it's going to go, but it's a terrible place. I'm sorry, but my first order of business when I decided to begin a career was finding some sort of support group for my nephew that I really wanted to help. And that's what i've been building, with our online counseling.We have an online counseling group for nephews. It's a very low cost, very low cost and not as intrusive as some other counseling programs in chicago.Bill moyers: well, the reason I gave it to you guys is that I needed help getting my nephew to move around. What was my first step?Beck raddatz: well, what I have learned from my family is that the worst thing that can happen when you have a family member who doesn't know you and who has been through a lot of toug...
243|we're in las vegas and a guy is sitting at his desk trying to pull out his wallet on the floor on a bed. There's this man who's wearing a shirt that says, "I'm with a local couple called the chihuahuas." And he's looking at a box of crackers on the table and is trying to buy crackers to eat. He's just trying to look at some of his stuff—just looking at the stuff that he's getting. He's not very good at it.What are you trying to tell him? We're not trying to make money. We're trying to look good.Ok. And then the other guy looks at the crackers and you're like, "Wow," He's like, "You really have that good quality cracker stuff in there. We'll eat it, we'll eat it. We'll eat it. We'll sit down and eat it and then we'll eat it. We'll stay in it for about a week and then we'll go back home and get it. It's not as fast as you'd think in the united states. We can't do it as fast as we like. It's all that matters to me. The more I use crack at breakfast, the easier it gets.Okay, okay, but the guy's got that nice looking knife, you know, and he's trying to buy crackers off me, and I'm lik...
244|The first woman at my workplace took a photograph of a young woman with her head down and her heart beating like a bull's ass. After she gave the picture to a friend and he got angry with her, she asked him to show her the photo. He did so and took the picture of her and asked her to sit next to him. He then proceeded to get her out of the picture. I can't even say I'm surprised that he went out and took photos of me with her head down. I've never had any problems with that. A lot of girls have gotten so upset with me because of my photos because they were taken without permission, and i've never even apologized for it. It's disgusting, because it's absolutely disgusting. And there's not a lot of people getting upset because of it. I'm not going to apologize to anybody for it because if there were, I'm not going to be around at all and it's getting a little crazy. I have no issue standing up for myself.And you're the one who put it out there that someone should be able to do that with impunity, because you have already done so for what you did.It's been the most upsetting thing i've ever done, and I never want to get into it again. I'm not gonna say I'm sorry for doing that, and I'm not gonna let this situation get in the way of my continuing to help other girls. And this may b...
245|When I first started playing as a student I had a strong feeling that it was an important game. I knew I'd be one of the players who could become the first one to play that game for free. And then I became very curious about who would play it and how that could actually work. So I played it before the finals and it was kind of a puzzle to figure out how to get to the finals. Then in the finals, the players of the team that had originally won the first game, they could go and play that game as well - the winning team had won the second game. So there was a big feeling of excitement about playing this game.Then in the final game, you could see that you only had to beat your first opponent by making a good guess, which is the way you were trained. Your knowledge of games from experience would be so useful. You would be able to win with a lot of practice in order to improve. So I kept playing against myself a lot.When I started playing online games and playing at the beginning of 2017, when I started making my first video games, my first video games were the games I would play in the finals.So those games that I made at the beginning would start on the following day, like when I was playing at the start of my first live tournaments and then in the finals. I also made more of those games when I began playing professionally for the first time. I started makin...
246|i've never met a man like the one I met in this room.My last meeting with her in this room was a week ago.She was in my room and she started crying as well.At first I thought 'i will never do that again'.All I knew about her was: she will never do that again…i took that moment to think.I could go on, but what she was going through was shocking.She was going through her life the way her mother had before she was in prison.She was going through a life full of trauma, with no hope for relief.It was truly shocking.It was telling. It was disturbing.But even more disturbing, it was that I found myself going back to her.I tried to talk to her. To her.But I never could.She was so traumatized that I didn't know what to do.But I could try.I went back to her and I cried as hard as my father tried.I tried to explain, but I was stopped by her.She said 'no, not yet. What are we going to do now?'I said: 'don't worry. We're going to have to go to another place. It's a nice place.'She was devastated and angry, an...
247|I have heard that you have seen the images of the body being carried away by the enemy, and now I know that we have seen that this man was alive. But I do not find it a crime to be frightened.The whole nation of the united states has been deceived by these images.The government of god has made an attempt to overthrow this body by force, to turn her captive into an evil man who will take her to her doom.Let us be clear. The idea that the world has been overthrown through the use of false religious and religious symbols is an absolute and unendurable falsehood.The lord has commanded that the enemy of his people should be killed as he did the king of persia, to be killed at the battle of the ninevah, and that on the second day of the fourth month, in the midst of the first night, all those who were in his presence should be slain by him, or should be taken captive by him, and all those who were not by him, and should be killed at that time.I am compelled to declare a solemn fact. The lord has commanded the world to do a great deal of harm to those that are not by him.I have seen the bodies of many saints and holy men that are now in the hands of the devil; and I have heard of their miracles and of their miracles which have been made over them. The lord has also commanded the worl...
248|the biggest problem with the current system is the fact that most people can't write code. All they can do is test their ability to write code. If they didn't understand something, they wouldn't run this app. A lot of people don't understand how it works.A common way to solve this problem is through design. A bad design doesn't necessarily mean the user doesn't understand what they're doing, but it doesn't mean they don't see it.I'm not saying that everyone can fix this design problem, but a bad design can hurt your app.There are so many reasons why this problem might exist. One of those factors is the fact that users won't ever want to change the ui. A lot of that happens because they're tired, want to change the view, or because they are concerned about the app itself.If you are unhappy with the ui, there are things you can do in order to keep the user engaged.In order for an app to work, you need to keep them engaged.I'm going to show you several ways to make app development more enjoyable by doing some simple, yet effective design.1. Keep the user engagedwhen an app starts making people wait, it's important to keep them engaged.It is hard to keep an active user when they are bored.The way to do this is by design.You ca...
249|A little girl named hannah. She's been raised this way over ten years, by her aunt, by her stepfather, by their two best friends. She's always been my little girl. She's always been happy to see me. Her dad is my best friend, and he's my biggest enemy. He's my absolute worst enemy. I'm supposed to love him. I don't even like him that much. I love him because I was raised to love people, and I want to help them. I really don't like my parents, though. He doesn't care. Not at all. He wants to punish me because I'm not good enough.The story begins with hannah being taken to the hospital with a broken arm. She's taken to the hospital with the bad luck that she is still alive, but her family have decided that there is no chance for her to live long enough to have a chance to go to her family, and there are a lot of things that could ruin her life. It's not long before she finds herself in a coma where her parents have to take her to a wheelchair to get her to see a doctor. When she does finally get to see her parents again, they believe that she has been brought up to be a hero, and that they wish that she could be the ones to save her from this awful experience.I guess I can't even begin to describe the feeling that permeates the whole film. It's no...
250|You go out and buy a new car, because you just want to drive it. You have a dream job: it's not going to cost you more than you are now.For the same reason, it's easier to sell a ticket, and it's much harder to get to a friend's house, or get out of a car that's been a little too big. It's harder to work your way through a few hours of work and finish out the day. It's just a different job, and it's just not the same.I worked as a retail sales associate for 15 years, and I'm a writer. I have a dream job that is not going to cost me $500 a week. It's hard to sell a ticket, but it's much harder to get to a friend's house, or get out of a car that's been a little too big. I'm working on a book in the first week of september. I have a dream job, and my dream is to write an all-star series of books. Then, a few weeks ago, I wrote something like "There's a magic bullet in the cupboard" That was just not worth the effort.If you've ever been to a convention, you know that I am an avid reader and you know that I love writing. You know that I have a great respect for writers, and that I know that I have a great respect for them: readers, fan...
251|on the morning of february 7th, 1990, I called my mother and said I had just lost my son, james.Now, it's been 26 years since I'd lost a friend.So, what i've come to know from this story, is that my mother never took it personally and never let me hold her hand.She never made any threats against my life or my actions, including against any of my friends.She never made any threats to my life or anything else. And I have found, even though i've said that I don't know.She never made any threats at all to me. As much as I feel, I know that if I want to stay alive, I can't go to a place like this and not find someone who has come to see me and know my story and feel sorry for me.I never said that I would go to a place like this.I never said I wouldn't be there with my kids...
252|When I first went to college, I was reading a book that the world recognized as a true story. It's a book where the world knows that you're not that good as a person.So I read this book and I remember thinking: "This is the way it happens to you. You're not good. You're not a good person." And so, when I started, I did not even have any money, but I kept doing things. Some of my friends who were living in the suburbs and had a job were living in the suburbs and they were really lucky because they couldn't afford the rent because they were just getting in line to get in. So after that, I kept doing things."It wasn't until my parents divorced that I realized there was something more, a whole new dimension to a person."Now when you think back to it, what was it like to be the kind of person who grew up with the same family?"They were great parents and that's what led me to get into my early 20s and I remember thinking — I wasn't going to get a job or anything. I didn't even know if I was going to get a job, if it was going to be the right fit for me."My dad had always been great, and I had always been a great friend – but just because my dad had always been such a great friend… that didn't mean I should stay awa...
253|I was in a car accident, and they said that they wanted me to come in with them. So they put my body in their hands, and the doctors said, 'the doctor will come in tomorrow. The doctors said, 'no, it's not important for you to come in tonight.' And I said, 'you better wait for them.' ""Then they said that the doctors would give a checkup and a diagnosis. They said, 'we are not sure what it is.' I said, 'no. It is very severe.' So I went to the hospital and the doctors said, 'no, we can give you this.' I said, 'no, wait, you will not come in today. No one can get you.' And they said, 'you know, you have a bad day here, right?' So I went to the hospital and they said, 'you do not have any trouble, please, you are ok.' And I said, 'yeah.'""Then the doctor said that we are still going to have surgery and that we can go home tonight. And when the doctor said that, she said, 'that's good, you can go to sleep later tonight.' So I went in her room and she went in my room and she went to sleep, and she went to sleep for three days while I woke up. So that's when it was that I became aware of myself as a person and as a person who wa...
254|A person who was a victim of a criminal offense was told they could not get a job because he had the 'good intentions' of a spouse or his children. The person was told the wrong thing, the wrong job. It wasn't until he was forced to change his life that he actually heard it, and that he realized he was being cheated. That's what I did with my son. The judge was the victim of a criminal act and it should have been obvious that he had acted in the wrong way and his behavior was simply an act of abuse of power, because of his marriage.What about the person who was put up for adoption when his life was threatened by violence or other means? It can't be denied that he was the target of abuse. That makes the problem worse. When those children were put up for adoption it was never even that. We've seen this in the case of michael jordan, in his case being put up for adoption.If I had to choose one case I'm going to try and make it clear what the evidence would have been to make this point. The evidence would have looked and sounded like what we've seen so far. That's been the fact I see people arguing over every single thing they see and nothing to go on. The fact I see people doing their jobs with little time spent in a car being a scapegoat of the wrong person, the reality is that the problem is in the system. We're taking ...
255|A young girl from bournemouth, in the south of england, and a man she was going to marry were suddenly in a big way going through something very serious. The young girl was in good spirits and told me about some of the old british trappings and things like a horse, which they used to get in their villages, and what they were told they would be asked to do by the lord's forces when they returned to the country. She told what she had seen. I told her about how people in bournemouth had gotten drunk and they were all drinking in a way that the english people would never have. So she told me that there was a kind of ritual and a kind of ritual, and all of the british people were going through it in ways that were totally different and in ways you don't just have to go on this long and go through. And then I went home and I felt very fortunate because I didn't have any kids, but I felt like I didn't have to. Then, the next day, and i've been to england, I went to a farm and I went to my local pub because I felt very lucky.I felt very fortunate that the farm, the local pub, where I was, was so close to me that there was no problem with me. In fact, it was a huge advantage because I was not going to miss anything from the pub after I'd gone to the pub. I didn't think it was tha...
256|it is on an old bridge.It is one of the few remaining bridges, with three separate sections that span the span of the bridge. Three different bridges, two of them of different colours. But what is this bridge?Yes, it is the bridge of a family in the town of rovaniemi, a small town in russia's far east. It is the main street of rovaniemi, the town that holds the place of pilgrimage for so many russian orthodox jews.At last time it is possible to understand how they came to rovaniemi, for rovaniemi is the only part of russia that is not part of the far east. Because of that its name, the town that houses the synagogue of the patriarch of krasnoyarsk, was named after him, a man who is venerated as a god among russians.But if you look at rovaniemi itself, there are no roads leading to it. If you take a very short road, it is a very long one. But if you take a very long road to the bridge of rovaniemi, you get a very short one, a very long one. The bridge is very short, so you need to pay a lot for it. In other words if you take a very long road to the bridge of rovaniemi, you get a very long one. And then you can buy a lot of cars whic...
257|You know, once I realized what this meant on the day I left the business, I thought, "I can't believe he is out there doing this for us, just like the rest of the country does. Now it's not just the company, it's this whole thing. He's an amazing guy, and he really believes in where we're headed with this business. He really believes in the people and the people are great. So I think he has something to show." I think it's very interesting to me. When I was talking to him a few years ago, he talked about how he wanted to put a little bit of a smile on his face, and I really think this is a very good gesture that I think he makes.We have a great relationship, and we also have a very close personal relationship. A lot of these companies, at least, are owned and operated in the united states. And, in those instances, they really want to be here with the people, and they're very involved in this whole process. So if it seemed appropriate for someone to come to see me, he'll probably do his best. It's not his business, and we've got a lot to talk about...
258|It's hard, it's frustrating, it's exhausting, and it's exhausting. But I think it's very important. The next step, I think, is, how can we help ourselves, how can we learn together, how can we build a better relationship?Richard stone: the next step for me is not to try to find a way to get rid of the idea that when you're having a bad day that you can somehow win it and you are doing good. That's not a way to win; it's not a way to win for yourself. That goes against everything that's happening in my life. It's not a way to win for myself, but it is a way to take responsibility for your life, for the fact that you're trying to do a good job of managing your life. You're trying to build your life, to build the future.Now, a really important thing we've learned over the last 30 years, and for a long time, was that you have to understand how to be a positive influence. It's hard to change how we play. But we have to learn to be positive. Now, it's an interesting thing to say -- I'm a teacher, and I'm a teacher is a very specific language where you can have a positive influence, and I do believe that if you were a person you could have a positive influence, you could have a positive influence. So, a lot of people tha...
259|We were driving in the south end of chicago. The people I was talking to were black, but my father said there were a lot of hispanics here. I asked the driver if he was hispanic and he wouldn't answer that because I didn't know he was hispanic or I was hispanic, but I was listening carefully and he said he was hispanic and I was hispanic. We went to the grocery store and were going by the way.This guy was wearing a white tie and he was carrying a black bag of money. He said he had been waiting for a cab out of chicago so he had got out of the car, and he said, "We gotta drive, you can't get past the cops. Just give us enough money." And this other guy was holding a piece of money and he said, "We gotta get you here by midnight tonight to get this guy out of here." And I said, "Yes, I did."I'm saying to myself, "Well, that guy was telling the truth in that he got all the money that he was being owed, it's a good idea. He got the bag. I got the money and he got it. And that was all I had left."A lot of other people in the parking lot just took it as a joke. So I left, I had a very nice black friend of mine who was a cop who had been with a lot of other cops for 15 years, probably 20 o...
260|At the time, I had an idea (of which I have never been able to prove) for our program. This was a one-off project that took about two weeks. Every day from that point on, we had a meeting at the school. Each morning we had a very specific meeting, where people from all over the world joined us. Sometimes they had been on the train for a few minutes, other times they were at the bar (where I had spent the last two years. And I was never alone, and sometimes they were still there). We had a lot of interesting questions for each individual, so I decided to ask them in the next few weeks. I started with the question, "Are you an american or a jewish person?" So, at the end of my three weeks, I asked three questions that I thought seemed like questions I wanted to ask. That is how the program would work. If you've read more about jewish schools and their history, I highly recommend reading this article by joseph stiglitz. For some of you who think that I'm just trying to make a "Fact," I am. If you remember his article the israel project: why zionism failed and why it never happened, you would also want to know about a jewish school for holocaust survivors in germany, where I teach. The main question was "How do you feel about this project?" The first thing I would like to write about is the program as it became known. The people ...
261|When I was a kid, I had a girl named rachel. It was just so weird, and you know, in these times of growing up as she could see the power of the universe, and the power of our family and our way of life, and how our parents could support their children. I'm not saying she was a bad girl, but it was hard not to see that in her mind.So, rachel left the house to go into college, and my dad really wanted to let her go.So, he asked whether or not you could go back to your family where you grew up?He asked if you could make sure that if you went home to see your mom, she would find out who you were. And she didn't want to stay either.Would you like to see a movie version of that?Yeah, I'm gonna do it.Well, maybe a little bit of something with some of those weird characters from your previous movies?Yeah, I like things like, "Hey, are you in the middle of what she thinks?" Like that. And it was really cool.Are there any other movies or works you would like to see the audience see?What?Well, some.So, tell me about your other movie.I really want to tell about that one. I really want to tell about how we think we're doing wha...
262|And here is what I mean. When I was a kid, my father had a little girl named aileen. She was very very beautiful. She was like my very own mother, and she knew her way around this school. She liked to do different things, and she was not a bad girl. She was a very nice girl, too, just like my mom, and I really do think that that was why she was very kind to me. I would go out to work, she would come in, and then my mom would come in, and I would do a big ol' party, which is usually some kind of dance. And she was very affectionate. And so, at that time, I got to know her really well. And we went around and she was very kind to me. And I think one time, in 1992, she came to me at my house, and she said, "Hello, my name is annabelle. And I am the president of a small company where we specialize in designing, building and providing professional products in japan. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?" And I am like, "Yes, I'm a business owner at wotan. I'm a japanese-american woman of japanese heritage. I am the vice president of my own company." And she said, "Well, it's a company called japan's best selling basket shop." And I was like, "Wow, that's really cool." The...
263|As we talked for about ten minutes, we were in a very small hotel on the outskirts of paris which is known for its richly furnished hotels. I noticed a pretty young woman and she was asking for drinks on her way out. I said, "My brother is staying behind." She said, "Don't hurry, I'lllet him out." I was pretty much in my car waiting for her and the taxi driver came up to me and asked me, "You're coming too, would you mind leaving my car?" I said, "I can leave you, it's a good hotel. I can wait on my friends and get my visa." He said, "Of course." He told me to leave the hotel and to come back to his hotel and he would pay it back.We arrived at my apartment on the outskirts of paris. The door and windows were open. I walked up to my room. My brother, who had just been visiting us, turned to see me. He said, "This is my sister, she's coming over here." I thought she was the one who had brought him a copy of the book I was working on, but she told him she didn't like it. I did not answer, she said she had to take care of it. I took her off and told her to leave me alone while I saw her. My brothers went down. I said my brother has been arrested for espionage and I feel sorry for him. ...
264|Your father was a professional wrestling announcer. You were a young boy with no idea that this was real, he was in middle school, had a really bad injury and couldn't do nothing.You grew up on this side of the world, but it got much darker. You went to a family-run wrestling school, you went to a wrestling camp, did some wrestling, then, when you went back to school you saw that you were going to be training in a ring.What would be your favorite part of that experience?It was a wrestling camp and all the kids were getting ready to go to wrestling camp. In the ring, you're supposed to be going and then you're going to be getting your shot. The way that it turned out was very different than, for instance, the way that the wrestlers get shot during wrestling camp. In any of the previous camps, you were always playing hard and you'd be on the other side of the line. In this time of change, you'd get up from home in the middle of nowhere and you'd just look at them and your face would just turn a little bit red. So it was extremely different.One day one of my friends came in and asked me what happened, and I told her I was going to be a wrestler, I was going to be a wrestler, and I was going to be on the other side of the line. And she told me, 'he's ou...
265|In the summer of 2007, I went to washington dc for the annual congressional black caucus meeting, where we sat down for 10 minutes, discussed the state of the game, and it turned into a good time to do it again.My friends were waiting in line. I started to talk about the black caucus. I told them about my own dream of being black, and that I was going to be a leader when everyone was here. People who were all just looking to go out and take part in the action, and that was what I wanted to do. I wanted to raise the profile of the black caucus in washington d.C., and this was one of those things that got me, and i've had more people who've been there than I can count, to take part in the black caucus. And so, we came to a place where people would say "This one is my dream," And I wanted to say "This one is mine," And I am still saying that now and then. And there's been great response from black folks, and then people came out and said "We need something like this, we need you to take on this campaign," And that was it.The black caucus has gotten bigger over the years. And it's gotten bigger and bigger. I just don't think the number of people who came out to protest it in the spring of 2011 was enough to convince those people to join me.You said at the time...
266|I've known this guy for over 40 years, and my wife has seen this guy go from having the job to being the most respected manager in the business who was hired. He's done everything, from coaching football coaches to teaching golf coaches. He has done all of it while working very hard and doing it in a professional manner. He's seen his brother grow up a good amount. He's seen his family grow up a lot, and he has a lot of money and experience. He has great support, and he has a strong family and friends. He's got a lot of friends. And he's got a lot of potential, but he has to be a guy who is willing to take what is right. I've always had the hope that his brother will grow up into a successful, successful manager. My wife said to me, 'there's a person who is the future, and he's got a lot to learn.' It's a very difficult thing to accept. I've always believed that a man has to have that hope, that he will grow a lot."I don't think i've ever seen that man. I've never seen someone who is willing to do that. He has to be very, very, very, very, very, very, very confident. No, that's not what I think of. His family has to stand up for what they believe, if they believe it. I've always believed I have that dream. And tha...
267|It's very good. I want to tell you a story about a boy that happened to be my hero.""Thank you sir," Harry said, standing up."Yes, sir," Ginny said in a soft voice. "I hope you have found your way back to the room. I hope you have found your way back to the world. Thank you, my boy.""Good," Luna said, her voice a little softer than usual. "Have I been overthinking that this could be a real opportunity?"Harry nodded. "We'll see. I'll be right back, but it seems the weasley twins and ginny are back. Do you think they could all get up in a few days to find you? Or would you rather wait here a while longer, or stay away for a while and go back again?"Ginny shook her head, and nodded firmly. "I could always turn back before they went back to sleep in their bed. Maybe I could find one of them."Harry had felt he was getting too late. He was too late that ron and sirius would never see each other again. He was too late that he would lose his memory for the rest of his life. That had been so far too early for him to be there again.No. He couldn't. He had to.But he'd have to.He would have to.He'd hav...
268|i started playing for a few years in junior high school, and played for a few years in college, and had to change coaches. Eventually, I dropped out and I had a family that I cared a lot about. I moved back home to kansas and I was very fortunate to be there. I thought there was an opportunity to play professionally for other teams – and to actually participate in that tournament. I had two very high school teammates, and we played a lot of basketball together.I'd only played a handful of games the first year of college, and the way I played the rest of my career, I felt that it would be the best chance to play for other teams. And as things have changed, i've become better. When I played for my alma mater in high school, those last three years I had a shot at becoming a pro. But I'm so proud of my freshman year, I think it worked out. I had a nice game against kansas that made me feel really good.I'm excited to get back into the game, to compete and win. And I love it. I love the university of kansas. It's a big part of my game, especially now that I'm in north dakota.I think as I get older, I look forward to playing a lot, just taking the minutes, working hard and not taking yourself too seriously. I feel like I get to play, and I feel like I can pla...

270|And here is what I mean. When I was a kid, my father had a little girl named aileen. She was very very beautiful. She was like my very own mother, and she knew her way around this school. She liked to do different things, and she was not a bad girl. She was a very nice girl, too, just like my mom, and I really do think that that was why she was very kind to me. I would go out to work, she would come in, and then my mom would come in, and I would do a big ol' party, which is usually some kind of dance. And she was very affectionate. And so, at that time, I got to know her really well. And we went around and she was very kind to me.

272|My parents were very happy with me. My mother liked to sing and I think it was nice for her to have that kind of talent. Our son had my brother and one of them was a singer, and I was very happy to see that. My mother has not spoken to me since."It was in december, 2008, that gervais was offered a job at the sydney opera house, but the opportunity had fallen by the wayside.His friend had written to him and said he had received another offer on a different note: the chance to act as his own agent."He asked the staff if they could send me a letter and they said there was no way I would be accepted," Gervais told the abc last month."I wasn't really interested in working. I wanted to work with a little theatre company."At the time I was making $5,000 a year, I was making so much money I couldn't afford it. Then again I was doing a movie at the time and I thought I would get it at a little theatre in new south wales, but I was too late."Gervais says that he had turned down a call when he first heard from her.He said that the audition was short-lived when he was approached by another agent and was told he had been "Betrayed"."He said, 'i'd like another chance.' ...
273|as I was coming out of a job interview last week and was about to walk into the store, I took off my dress and started walking to the door. It wasn't a normal moment, it was a surreal moment.I was trying to keep my arm out of your face before your eyes, but the way you could do that, I knew you were in that situation. I tried to pull you away from that feeling of being lost or being afraid.The only thing I wanted was a hug, and that's where you were. Your smile was so real, and everyone was so happy.I said goodbye to you and walked over to where you were. I said thank you, and we hugged for a while, and we were happy to know that that feeling would last.After that, I left the store and went back into the store, so I could ask you again. I was so proud of that moment.It was a great experience. I had an incredible time.This one should never have happened.I'm so proud to be with you...

We went to the airport there for free and were very kind.A couple of days ago, I was driving by a group of people just in the middle of nowhere. They told us that it was a good time to go to the airport. I got a great feeling, and that we had got to our feet. We said, you see this little town. It's like a little village. And there's a little town there, where you can go fishing. And then, you know, you go to a beautiful lake where there are some magnificent places to go fishing. And it's just kind of amazing, you know?I was like, you know, it's not your home anymore. And he said, the best thing about this little place is that you can come back.

275|You know. When I was 16, I came from a part of africa where they had never allowed me to visit. Our teacher was a young student in the university of california who did not have a visa so I would go to africa with a group of kids and we would go to the campsites and the campsites would be like, "There's nothing that I can do at this camp. All I can do is go there. I'll be home by the time they get here." But I never saw anyone say that, I don't know. You know, I was so shocked. You know, the first time I was introduced to missionaries, there was a group of people who were in the camp to help with the children's education. They were from the u.S. South african mission and they are really proud to be here. You know, I was so shocked. And what they said is, "You know, he's not a christian, you don't know." My god, I had no idea. I was just shocked this whole experience.Bill moyers: now I want to ask, after the fact, what were you doing at this time, at the united church of christ?Richard cheney: I spent a couple of years in uganda.

276|i was talking with my husband, who was in his 50s. We had been living in the car shop at that time where we had an auto. We were driving down a highway in the middle of nowhere and I was driving to a party. We had just parked in a store on the corner of third avenue and fifth avenue. I started going down, down and around fifth avenue and they said, "I don't want us to stop there." They said, "Let's go ahead," And I started turning around, down fifth avenue, across the street. I was turning just right by third avenue, and they saw me. They said, "Oh, it isn't like we're going to stop there," And I just said it, "Ok."They went back and forth between the shop and the restaurant, and it just got to be a blur, because everyone in the restaurant had already left their cars. This guy had just got out of his car; he was out of his business, and he was going to leave, but when he got back in the car, I realized: he was in his 50s. I remember running over, and he just was on top of me, and he was moving the car, and I was coming across him. Then I saw him just falling out of the car after I tried to turn around. There was a big tree down the road, and he just landed on the ground from being hit. The tre...

So what happened is this guy, we have an attorney here. One of the people that is at my school, he got shot dead. I have called him and said the man was a terrorist, and we have a family here. And he has been a teacher, now I have the chance to teach him. And I will tell you, I am the same person here, I have been here my whole life, I want me to be here in my own community, so we are working together to make this community better, because I am a muslim, I am a mother, I am a father. I came here to learn, because when you are a muslim, you do not do what your country tells you you can go.

278|In 1983 I worked in a restaurant in the town of kwan, one of the largest towns in the world. As we were trying to arrange a meal, a waiter grabbed my arm and started talking. "Why are we in here?" He asked."Because we are a foreigner!" I replied, and he gave me the thumbs up. My arm was shaking. The waiter grabbed my arm again. And by this time my hand was shaking; I was shaking like the wind.He said, "I'll show you the front door. The people must know there is only a narrow hallway. Now you have to pass this door. The next door is next to the bar, and it is next to this bar for drinking. Why aren't you in here?"I couldn't respond because I felt like a coward, and I could feel my hand shaking. In a moment I was done, and in another I couldn't even say anything. I had to make a sudden stop.I knew I wasn't ready to face this danger any more, but I did it anyway. I knew I had to. I knew I had to not let him get in. And as I did, he was shaking, too.What a lucky feeling, when I saw a small group of people in front of a liquor store, and one of the liquor store employees, talking about what had just happened, and my friends, and I were both laughing uncontrol...

I started saying, I don't want to live with this guy anymore. I don't want to make this man feel any pain in his life. I don't want this man to want me. I don't want him to feel pain at all. I want him to know he has a voice in this conversation. He didn't want me hearing him. He didn't want me seeing him.""It's amazing," Said gee, who declined to be interviewed. "The biggest thing was I'm still able to walk on my hands and knees here. I could tell him, 'this is what I want.' And he said, 'you're never going to be like this.'"Gee didn't believe this, but when he heard it, his voice was as strong as ever."I'm so sorry," He said.Gee said that, in the years since the incident, he has never forgotten."For people to think I'm never going to be like this is unbelievable. It was one of the worst things that i've ever done. But that's just something that can happen. As a basketball player, that's not going to happen again....
280|I was talking to some of the top investors who got into the game. The top guys in the game, and the top executives in the business, came together and decided to take a hard look, and they came up with a vision. And they wanted to do it this way. And these guys came together, and they saw a vision when they came up with the plan to make the gaming industry more inclusive by making it more like home to the gamers in the industry. And they were willing to go so much forward. So it wasn't just about the game industry. It was a whole lot more than that.I had been working at the development studio of microsoft and I got a call, from a guy who was on the board of the next gen. He said, "Well, you can't just take the game business to places that are not there anymore. So there's a chance you may lose some employees, or some things will change. You're going to be in a different place. But you'll know who you're talking about. You've got a chance to stay in that corner. And then there's going to be a lot of people going to new york, and I'm thinking of that.

281|A week after an alleged attack on new york city's metropolitan museum of art, a young man called michael fuchs, 23, stabbed a young artist at the national harbor in brooklyn. Four months later, he opened fire at a synagogue by shooting himself in his back. When law enforcement authorities announced last month that he had been found to be behind the stabbing attack, he received a barrage of press attention.Since then, a steady stream of outlets have called out and published allegations against the mayor. This is the second time, after weeks of being denied coverage and coverage of the new york police department's investigation, that this story has received attention. The first time, in february, the new york times called mayor michael j. Bloomberg out on his role in the attack on the city hall and the subsequent charges, and the second in the aftermath of a recent video that was posted on social media.A week later, the times reported that, in the days before the attack, j. O. R. Johnson, an nypd detective, had been working with the department's internal affairs complaint management unit, which investigates crimes against the public. It is the fourth time in less than two months that the times has made such an appearance. On friday, the times, in an editorial called "The mayor's latest role in a serious incident," Wrote that johnson was a "Doubtful man" Who had been "Unfit in the positio...
282|I remember driving up the road to my home in new york on the way to work. I had just done my first major project (a post-mortems) and wanted to get a job. But I was in a bad mood. I didn't feel a thing about it. I felt like I was a burden. I didn't want to think of something bad that day. I didn't want to feel like I wasn't there. And I didn't even get over it. I had been waiting for this for months. And it came, and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse. That's just one story I kept telling myself for six years.I've told many stories, but this one is my best. It's the one that really drives me. And it's my story.I'd been in a bad mood the day that I walked up. I'd turned in my car and just stood there for a second. I hadn't heard anything. There was no one in front of me. I looked around. I had never seen anybody before. The front window was rolled back on me. All I could see was a man and his dog. I turned to turn toward the window, and saw my neighbor standing over me. He was wearing a baseball cap. He had his hands around my neck. And I looked up. I had never seen a human face before.Then I heard this loud crack. I didn't know wha...
283|I was in a car with the couple who were going out on the town the other day and when we stopped there was a man at the wheel. The man called himself daniel jones, he had never really thought about it before and said he had seen an intruder and that he wanted to have a gun, but a man came up and told me to get on the seat. I went up and said, 'who are you? Daniel jones was a real gentleman.' He then pulled out his gun and said, 'let's go with you.' I was like, 'you'll get your life together. I can't let you escape tonight.'"Brett mcgurk, 26, shot and killed his 17-year-old brother and his cousin, but escaped with only minor injuries. He was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead two days later.It is not clear exactly how many people have died from gunshot wounds in the recent past, saying that they have found their way to the local hospital due to lack of supplies.One of the victims was a family friend, who survived the massacre. The deceased man had just returned from a tour of the us and told his uncle of his gun in his possession.He said: "I was just about to take a picture when I heard a loud bang. I thought that was my brother daniel jones."A witness, who asked not to be named, said: "I had jus...

In the meantime you've lost thousands of your closest friends to cancer.You can be one of the brave ones here. But sometimes you're left in the lurch.When you're not feeling the pain of being alone, you're feeling the pain of losing all your friends.And you're left with a lot of baggage.And that doesn't stop you from being brave. So i had a son. It was 3 years ago at the age of 4. I had been blessed to be able to be in the role of father. I was a big boy with a special voice that I could understand, someone that everybody in my family could relate to. I'd been lucky enough to be able to bring him up in a safe environment at school.So I started having conversations about my life and where to start. And I realized I wasn't giving up. My parents were so supportive of me and my journey, especially my brother, who was so sick, but he was still doing great. My parents were not as supportive, but they trusted me as a person on the journey and I wanted to do something about it so they could make sure it was successful.I had a big family.The youngest was 14, and my father wa...
285|in my first day as a professional basketball player, I played for two teams, the kansas city wizards and brooklyn nets. I played with the team for three years. One of the guys in the locker room said, "You know what, look, you have to do this." I made it. My first year as a professional player, I didn't play any nba games.I was in the team for less than a month and I was playing with my girlfriend. There I thought, "Hey, we have to keep playing because we just don't have enough time for this. We need to have the talent to move up, and that means getting more shots off the dribble, and that means getting better against the ball. It's kind of an all around problem. That's why I can't play for a team. I can't play for a coach, because he's got a lot of experience, and he really needs to have all these different ideas. I don't want to have to look at it this way."That's what we did, and that's what I'm here for. This game, this organization, this team is all I need right now. The people I was playing with made sure everybody knew what was going on and what was going to happen. We didn't have enough time to see it. We knew we had to go.And if you look at the game tape, you can see that the last ...

287|i don't want to do anything that might embarrass you. If you get into a war, you have to go out of your way to avoid being shot — even when you're in a position to do nothing and it's raining. The way to avoid being shot is to stand up in the rain. And when you're in a position to be an enemy, you stand up in the rain. I'm an american. That's about it. I'm proud to be american, and I want something in the way that americans stand up in the rain.We have to work together to overcome these tragedies. And my name is john, and I think the way that I choose to say it is that when our country gets in trouble, we don't talk about it, we talk about how to make this country stronger. And when we do that, americans will understand. Americans will understand why they have been fighting so hard for this country.And if they don't respect each other in the way that america has, we will not be able to win.Question: can you tell us why it was that the u.S. Had the right to protect the american people and why it did not?Lunt: the first question is, if we can't defend the american people. It's very clear that we could not defend ourselves if we had the right. And it was a mistake to put the united states on the defensive...
288|A woman was walking along the beach when the first wave of the tsunami hit. People were frightened as they were watching the tsunami blow through a huge chunk of the sea. As they were getting scared, a man came out with a gun on his face. He got up and then his gun was out. It was really scary. And then he came back and fired again. And this man who was scared came out and shot down his gun. He was wounded pretty badly. He still lives the rest of his life with his wife.I remember it as a terrible reminder and it reminded me that people are still grieving and they still have hope. Just this day, we're having people like this just get their stories heard because they know it's not always that simple.You can also read the rest of the speech for more.Image via shutterstock...

I had her come up with the idea of this. I went to school, and she brought her a pencil. I said, "What are you going to do with the pencil?" And she said, "I want to draw something that I like while you're in front of me. This pencil has all of my favorite words." So she drew and I wrote them and I created this pencil. And I drew this pencil. And she realized that, you know, I'm not a professional artist. And she was like, "It's a lot easier to write a poem than to write a song, isn't it?" But I was like, you know, that's a big deal. She was like how cool is that?And my question to you, you know, is, what is it like to create lyrics, and I don't know if I should say more, but I'm so very creative and like I don't want to sound boring, but I want to feel like I'm doing what I'm doing, and I want to write things that I want to write. Like, it's, like, there's nothing wrong with that, in fact, it's just, like, I think it's really fun...
290|On the day when I learned you were in college, I was in my mid-20s, and I had a friend with me who had been a sophomore at st. Thomas and was in his mid-20s. His first few days, we were trying to find things at a bar in the neighborhood on w. Main street, and I remember looking around and seeing that there were a lot of tables and people that were playing ball. And he said, "So what's your name?" I said, "Jeff." Then he told me a lot about st. Thomas, and that's where I first got interested in his games. I was very interested in the college game. I loved the game. I loved to learn the basics. And I really wanted to learn the game's history. I wanted to play in a tournament. I didn't know it at the time, because I was not good at the game. But during that time, I was very focused. My mother was working for a game company, and I was not at home. And I just watched games and played. I could tell she was busy. But I don't think I really understood what it was like to be a pro in college.Q: you started playing competitive sports about six years ago when you were playing pro basketball. How did it all develop?A: I played an exhibition game with a guy called "D-j," Which was very intimidating. We had this gu...
291|We were driving down from our city a few weeks ago. They didn't know anyone. We stopped at the intersection of south beach and south shore drive. We were just parked in one of them. We were just like, "You know what? We're the only ones that know this city." A lot of people were just wondering what we were doing. We drove past them because it was just a bunch of cars. It was just some sort of parking spot, maybe a strip mall. We all had this really hard time keeping our heads out of the sand. They were taking pictures of us for a couple days. Then, three or four people were driving by. And then they started coming over. And then they started texting me and saying, "Hey, let's go back to our neighborhood." There used to be a lot of people that walked on the beach. I don't think I ever saw anything like it. It was just a great atmosphere. And at one point during the day, I sat on the side of the road and sat next to somebody who was driving a pickup truck. And one of the people had been sitting up in my truck and looked at me and said, "We need to go back to this street where the people aren't driving." And I was like, "That's right. I can't go back right now. I can't do this." I was like, "Sure, we'll go back somewhere else." So, I went bac...
292|One of those things I want to tell you is that I was reading with my son and my father, and as I read, it became obvious that they were going to tell this all to their daughters, which, in fact, they had learned over the years, and were very interested in. And there was a very interesting situation where you look at the kids and they are still asking this very interesting question. It's an age that is very, very new for them. And that is, I think they are all very, very much interested. And so when you meet a lot of these young people and they are in a very intense situation, they are really excited, very, very interested in it. It's something that I will tell them as they come to this new place, and I think it's a lot better for them than in previous times when people seemed to be more focused, and they tended to leave things for the kids to do, so there are a lot of people who want to go to that place.Martin: and the way they do it?Sezal: no, there are lots of people who go through that. And I mean, they go through a lot of different types of work, but if one of the other two kids comes to you and says, "I want to go this place that people are all looking for, like that book that they want to read and that they have read and that their parents think i...
293|A man named james. He came to the house with a friend, and we went to his house to discuss this marriage. He asked me who he wanted to marry and I said it was me. James said, "You're going to marry me, I'm going to marry myself. I just want to get married." He was not an accomplished man. He had very little money. He wanted to get married. I said to him, "I'm just like you." He just said, "Who?" He said, "My name is john. I was trying to get married for a while, but I couldn't get married. I had to get married, and after I got married, I got married." So I got married, and we got married. Then, on january 6th, 1859, I got married to james womack at the new york inn. He was a real good man, very honest about his love for this woman. James wanted to have her marry him, and I said no. He said, "I can't marry you." So I said, "You do not want to marry me, for I have to find a mate for you, right now." He said, "You have no one." I said no. I said that I wanted to marry him, and I was very well-connected with the new york inn. He said, "Can I please marry you?" I said, "Sure, you can get one....
294|The one you need to hear for yourself is about a girl who died on a bus at the end of a street chase in toronto. Her story is something about an abandoned bus and she was pulled over by an officer. A girl who died. But it was the driver of that bus, who turned the corner and who killed her.Well, I'm not talking about the passenger, but the driver of the bus who saw the driver, was in distress as soon as he saw his name on the driver's badge. His name was officer royce, he had been shot. She was taken to the royal ontario hospital where she died.The man that took her to the hospital was a father of two that was a canadian citizen and he was the only person that he knew of being killed in that bus. So that is all you need to understand. That is a huge tragedy.You hear what you want to hear. We are a free country and we need justice, so it is hard to hear you complain about a girl that died that was pulled over by the police. No, I can hear them complain about being pulled over. I can hear them complain about being pulled over that this is our country and we need that justice.It comes and that is all this does is to show that we are talking about an illegal driver, and that police are wrong. We are talking about someone who is not an officer. That is not the world we liv...
295|We had a couple of people who'd come out of high school, came with us into a house with these huge kids and they were like, "Wow we're really doing this." So, they'd just sit around for five minutes staring at us, really watching and they were like, "Wow, you should make this thing that we made for you. That's amazing!" Because we're the only family, right? We had no money to do this thing. We have a nice apartment. We have no kids to take care of. We have no parents to take care of us. And we had no one to talk to. We had no way to talk to."I did want to make the movie because I knew a couple of people were going to like the movie.""I did want to make the movie because I knew a couple of people were going to like the movie." While he made the movie, smith had his own character on the film. He didn't have anything else in mind and just sat around and sat around and you'd watch this guy's character get eaten by a giant shark and not realize that was it or that wasn't it."I started doing the character over and over and over again. It was just more and more and more."We had never even read any of the other things smith's character was trying to make. So, in the time smith had, we actually had three episodes of the characte...
296|And remember this, we need you to tell it, I know this because I have been trying to tell it to you for about three decades.The way that this was done, the way it was done would not be fair that people would think about who I was or what kind of things we do. We have a lot of other reasons. I had three jobs, so I don't have much time.But I do have one problem.We had this problem. We had this situation where the president, when he came into office, made $12 billion in the first three months of 2010. I did this with my first year.And I don't do that now, but my wife and my children can't. We couldn't afford to go to college. The schools are not going to pay our school costs. You know, I went to a college that was a terrible choice for the whole country. We still wouldn't pay for it. This was a country where it wasn't a bad deal — the worst economy we could do at that point was a country where it didn't even pay for itself.I don't know if I could go to a better college in the united states. My mom said, "Look, I'm not going to go to any of your schools. If you're going to do this, I don't want to go to any of their schools because my parents voted for me and they'll take car...
297|It's a story I got from a book I read a couple of years ago. I got this idea that there was a place where you could buy a lot of stuff for less for less. That they were like, "Wow, this is just stupid and I never bought anything here," "Okay, so I bought a lot of this stuff for less and the price is right now?" And my brother just said, "Yeah, there are no stores in this city that will sell these kind of things. That's why you have to go to the mall." And I just got that idea. So, yeah, it's really cool for people to look at this and be like, "Oh my god, this is really interesting and this is why we need to look at this."Avc: you mentioned that people can buy anything you want. How do you feel about the notion that people can get whatever they want and still get something if you don't, because if you're giving away something you want to give away, you can't give away stuff that really gives somebody something.Jb: well, it's always a slippery slope, sometimes. You know, we've been thinking about it for a very long time. But I think that it's kind of a shame because sometimes you just want something that gives you something to give. And so, if you buy a thing, you may find people who want you to give away som...
298|I was a little boy, when I was about six, and when I was seventeen, the family of the two hundred and fifty-three year old, who my mother says was my father and uncle, and who he was with her sister, were all murdered to make way for me. I was twelve years old, and we, the children, went to school on our own. One of them was just getting out of the school when she saw us coming by at full speed to make mischief. The other one was the one who had the knife through his throat, and his aunt took it out in order to see what was going on. I can never forget this horrible scene. It can't have been the same in any other time. There was a large crowd of people, and this woman came over and asked me to give her a little of her family's money. I told her that I thought that she was my grandmother, and she said that she had a lot to do, and she had a lot in mind. So we were in the school, and I asked her what was going on. She said that my aunt was in some trouble, and I was going to get her out, and she told me that I had all along tried to take her money, and that this would be very good. So I went and did what I wanted, and she got a little money out of my way, but I did not get out of trouble, and I got back about on...
299|The other day, we were sitting outside, and we heard a car come up out of the parking lot. This car was just so small. The driver had gotten out her suv, and in between, we could see her car was all white, her front bumper was yellow. She had her hands behind her back, and her head was all the way up, and then as you see from the video from the car, she was just shaking. And I looked up at my daughter and saw this black suv. And then everyone was cheering and cheering. And then everyone said, "What's going on?" And I said, "This is crazy." And I felt horrible. There was no doubt there was a struggle going on there, with those two young people who had just died. I thought that was terrible. There was no way that they'd come back from an accident and not make it through the day. And then I said, "Well, my god, I'm going to tell them to go home." The driver didn't want them to leave, because she said she wasn't doing anything to help, but she wanted to help them stay calm and put in the best effort possible. She was just doing her job. And that just set off a chain reaction. I said to her, "Oh my god, what are you doing?" So when she looked at me and said, "It was some bad luck. Did you hear the car?" I said, "Yes...
300|in the middle of the early 2000s, an oil spill in florida turned into a major international economic disaster, and there is no way to predict how the disaster will spill across the u.S.The next decade or so will be the first of many, if not the most, disasters with massive effects on the economy and the lives of untold numbers of workers.The biggest effects are in the energy sector, where there will be thousands of jobs lost every year. The energy industry is a $12 trillion industry — and the jobs in it will be wiped out by what is known as the clean power plan — which is what will result.The clean power plan is the most important environmental program in u.S. History, and the second of its kind. It set a dangerous temperature cap, put the nation's power grids on alert, and made it possible for thousands of fossil fuel companies to burn off their dirty energy.Today's disasters will be catastrophic for the country, the world, and the planet.It is impossible to know all the facts about the situation until you have been informed by experts, lawyers, the press, and even the best scientists within the oil and gas industry.I would not presume to be able to predict what will happen from the air at a national level.My best guess is that the next big disaster will be a spill from a natural gas well that could cause a massive leak out int...
301|I was reading through the newspaper this morning and it looked like there was some information about the trump campaign having to do with russian interference. My boss sent an email to the campaign on may 14 saying that if something was going on in the 2016 election he would be looking into it. The email went out to the staff. It's all about russia. There was nothing about this. Not only this, but it was a totally fabricated story that was not only false but completely fabricated.So what is that? I think it's a very broad range because I do have a few things I have to prove, I mean, if president trump is looking into it and then you're not looking. And they're looking at this one case where president trump had to face his advisors and it's obviously a very serious matter. This case where the president has to face these tough advisers who are in charge of his campaign. You've got to have the ability to get this stuff to pass. The only thing I can say here is if you look at russian election meddling, there is no doubt about that.Gross: and as we have been saying, this is the top-secret russia investigation. And they are investigating trump aides who were present at the event. And they're being investigated by special counsel robert mueller. Are you sure what that means?Kamy potty: I mean, I don't know where the word 'special counsel' came from. W...
302|"I said 'yes,'" The man said."He said it's a very good drug, and I had to pay for it," The man said."I said to him 'what are you buying for me?' He asked him," He said."And then he pointed out that I had a bag of marijuana inside of me," He said."Then the man said 'why are you selling it for my cash?'"I said,'why is the guy selling me a couple of pounds of marijuana for a couple of cents?' He said."He shrugged and said 'you're not selling it, you're not doing anything wrong.'""Because I told him that," The man continued."I said 'you're selling it for my car,'" The man said."Because I told him that," The man continued."'Why are you selling it to your children?' He asked'because you're doing something wrong.'""That was probably the last time he saw me," He said, as he sat on our table.He said it was really hard to explain.Then the man asked if it was the end of the world....
303|It's pretty obvious why i've done this. I wanted to make my voice one that could be heard by you.""That's right." He spoke carefully to his friend, "You know, I didn't want you thinking that I could be your teacher. I thought it would be nice to be able to be someone your friends were. However, I was really just looking to see how you were feeling when you were a child. I really didn't want you to feel bad. I wanted to be loved, if only for the time being. It was just a matter of how I felt with myself and you in mind. I have no intention of ever falling in love with you again, nor would I ever do anything like that again.""You can be your teacher." I nodded."No, no, I can be it. I'm not your teacher, and I will never hurt you or make you feel bad, either." His hand rested against mine, "I'll teach you what love means to you. I will give you everything you can handle to be as happy as you can be with someone you love. I will tell you about yourself, to you how you feel and I'llshow you how you can do just that.""Alright, so you're going to be a good person, your friend." I said with a smile that only he could understand. That smile didn't feel like him doing it....
304|in early february, just weeks after the election, a man in the audience of a group called the american civil liberties union, had a telephone call with him that he claims had nothing to do with the election, which he claimed was "Incidental."The caller was an organizer for a group called "Stop trump" Who were looking to mobilize members of the trump campaign for protests against the upcoming presidential election. He was trying to mobilize their support for trump, but had heard nothing from the other participants. They kept quiet about it until the caller spoke to another caller who claimed he was part of "Stop trump."One day, on a saturday evening, in the middle of the night, I got an e-mail from a friend who had a different story. He told me a friend had been talking about getting a "Stop" Before trump won the election. An organizer for a new group called the action for trump, which was formed around this issue, told me that the organizer was upset.This group was based in orlando, florida, which was the site of the election. They had an event near the university of miami with the main event being "Stop trump" Happening at 5pm. The organizer didn't want to come to his event, because at that time, he had a good reputation with activists, and I thought he would be better off staying in my home city. He had met with me about a week later. He said he was frustrate...
305|There had been one big, massive scandal. But instead of talking about it, these were the kinds of things the media said. And then, of course, hillary clinton and barack obama both didn't want this to happen. But it's time we had a discussion. I mean, look, donald trump. And he was right. He said this was a political issue, which he didn't want to talk about. Hillary did something right. And at the same time, he said it was the right thing. And he got out of the way and let everyone else say it. Hillary clinton and barack obama both did not want this.And that was the big, huge scandal.But, of course, donald trump, he said, I believe that the right thing to do is to withdraw from the paris agreement. And at the same time, he said, we have to begin to renegotiate some of the terms of the paris accord. And he got out of the way. It should go back to the american people.So, I think that we can get through this. I think we can get through this. But the fact that we're only eight weeks from the end of the year, the fact that we're only eight weeks away from election day, is really troubling. And so it's time we had a discussion. And that's what we can do right now. We're gonna move on to a bigger, better, better program. And tha...
306|With my own socks, the first thing I did was check in and see if they were nice.I went to my store to get a pair of socksi put them in my bag and looked at them.She went back to the supermarket with them, and they were really, really nice.So I came home and saw that the socks were really nicei went back to my store.She told me that they were just some of those new socks from the brandthey were super soft.I sat back, and she told me my store was in a corner of the storei said, "What do you think?"...
307|i'm doing two things right now right now.There's a family reunion.I've got to go to bed later.I have to go find some time.My son is coming home at 3 tonight to pick up his kids.But he's been on his way home to his home in michigan.I've got to go.My husband, my son, is missing.He came up with the idea of going to michigan and taking the kids and raising the family.Now, we're back home.I've been doing a whole lot of good for the family.The way i've been doing this for years is that i've been doing this, and this is what's going on now.The way i've been doing this for years now is that I have been doing this.This family is going to this very special time.They've been here for five years, seven -- and i've got to do what I can to help.I can go to the family, I can go to the kids, I can go go home and work on my own.Right now it's all about me, this family.It's all about me.It's all about me.It's about me.And I just want you to know.I want to b...
308|This is a little-known fact. They were once in a gangland. For a time, they used to go out with prostitutes. Now, they're in a family called the 'struggledome'. They were called 'the strugglingome' because they all had two mouths and they were very, very close friends and they all took care of each other. They were very close friends that day, though because they had no clothes to hide, they didn't keep any of their clothes for their own amusement. One day, they went to a very attractive man and said, "Let's go to the club, we're coming for some dancing!" So they did it. Another time, a lot of the prostitutes were in a room called the 'strap. She just kept on going, and when the guy came out of it, they had a big big, big kiss on her face and they had a big kiss on her neck before they would show up. So she had a good time. She made a lot of money. In fact, she had a lot of money, because she had a pretty attractive little girl named miss. And she had two little sisters who were sisters with her. And she was a good girl, very well dressed, and a good dancer, I think. That's what was fun about it. The other thing was, and that's one of the big problems with prostitution as a business, is that it's very unorganize...
309|I'm 23, and I'm in my late 20s. My brother is 27. I'm a young man. A friend of ours from school is 28, and I have a great aunt who is very beautiful. She's a great mother of three kids in our house. She took us across the country and was just here to teach me this special book called "The perfect marriage." I didn't know what to say to her and I was upset because her sister had been a very strong mother to her daughter. She did the best she could for her girl. So what did she do then, take out her cell phone and call the police? She took out the phone and called the police. They put my brother in a big police van. They put him in the backseat of my car and pulled him out. I've spoken to him once before. We've been together for more than six years and have lived together and talked about everything, but now I have to go to the police because I didn't want that. That is what he threatened me. I told him, "I want to go to jail for this." So I don't know what happened.I was talking to my sister. My sister said, "Your brother has been in jail for the past three years. There is no hope. If you ever get out of here, you're going to be a bad father to your kids. I want you to have this." My sister said, ...
310|I have been around the place for 25 years. In that period, I have had some sort of connection to the country and people around me that are like me, just like in the past 25 years, i've been a citizen," Said ms. Miller. "And I think the best way to know what's happening in our society is to know what our story is, so that we can make sense of it."Ms. Miller said that although she had lived in her family for 25 years, she never attended her college classes."My mom is a lifelong supporter of our cause, but as soon as I moved to california, it just wasn't a thing," Said ms. Miller. "And so it never really became a thing."In late 2002, ms. Miller moved to los angeles to become a full-time employee at a local company. She said it was her mother who moved her to the area in the 1970s when she was young."She worked four jobs to pay the bills," She said. "As I got older, the fact that I stayed home and didn't live there for many of the years, I realized it really had become my own place."She said she now travels to san francisco and san jose, california to work as a reporter and editor and also as a private-equity attorney."With my family i've gone in and tried to be involved with their issues," Said m...
311|i don't want to do anything that might embarrass you. If you get into a war, you have to go out of your way to avoid being shot — even when you're in a position to do nothing and it's raining. The way to avoid being shot is to stand up in the rain. And when you're in a position to be an enemy, you stand up in the rain. I'm an american. That's about it. I'm proud to be american, and I want something in the way that americans stand up in the rain.We have to work together to overcome these tragedies. And my name is john, and I think the way that I choose to say it is that when our country gets in trouble, we don't talk about it, we talk about how to make this country stronger. And when we do that, americans will understand. Americans will understand why they have been fighting so hard for this country.And if they don't respect each other in the way that america has, we will not be able to win.Question: can you tell us why it was that the u.S. Had the right to protect the american people and why it did not?Lunt: the first question is, if we can't defend the american people. It's very clear that we could not defend ourselves if we had the right. And it was a mistake to put the united states on the defensive...
312|It was during the early, early part of the nineties that I felt that it was really important to find, and for the sake of the story, to take the action at the level of our characters who were already there. But the truth is, it was the roleplaying community that I was at that point in my life that gave me the real sense of what an action-action character could be.What i've seen in the last two weeks is that the number of players who have been playing a level, and who are looking for opportunities to play it, has increased. And so, what I think is a good thing is that we're at the level where we can play it on their own, with our friends, and we can have a group of friends come out and play their level and it's all fun. And if someone's saying to me, "Just follow me and I'lltake that person," Well, I can do it. And the other thing that happens is, it grows so fast that it just leaves a lot of people sitting there thinking, "Well, I'lltake that person."In terms of people who have played a level and their friends who've played it, the majority of that will be in north america. What are you doing right now that's going to help people get started, really. What are you going to do to try and bring this in to the world?[laughs] yeah...
313|I was working on a project, and I just happened to do a lot of talking. It was during a conference, and I'm from the us, and this guy, who asked me that question, was very, very gracious. And he got me to stand in front of a large wall, and he got me to stand up and say, "Hey, I'm a journalist." I'm talking to a lot of people in silicon valley. And he said, "You've got to go to your own business, and you want to go to your own business." And he wanted me to go to my own business, and I didn't have a choice. And then he told me that my business was on the line because the guy in the back of the booth, he was very, very good at this stuff. And he said we're going to be doing a show on facebook that's going to be a feature of the show on the show. They were going to put the money down, and, well, they were going to start on a website called vimeo, a show that would be about two people working on a small production company, but they were going to be taking an art project. So I was like, "Well, okay?" And he said, "Sure. Let's do that." So I was like, "Well, let's go do a feature on the show. We're going to be showing a bunch of these people, and we're goin...
314|My friend and I have been on a boat for just over a year now and it has been fun. We have been out on the waves, it has been fun to be here for a while and we are enjoying it there too. We have had quite a few moments out here. So I want to tell you a few things. And yes, it has been a lot of fun. It is very exciting because you have been here for only a few weeks and then maybe we will see how things are going to come out. But at the same time, I want to talk a bit about what we are going to do with our life now.There are no plans to move to this new space so I would like to make it a reality. But I know that if you are considering moving forward with your business, you want to know more about what kind of business you would like to do.And I would ask you to be kind enough, to be honest, to be honest about who we are as a company and what we are about. I would ask you to follow me on facebook, twitter, instagram, and pinterest. It is my way of helping out. I hope that will do a lot for you. And to the end of the day I hope we can build a beautiful beautiful home for you and for you to spend the rest of your life here...
315|A friend of mine came to us while we were camping with friends. I told him we would have to leave our tents to leave to go up to the hill with him, and we did. We stayed a week there and went up and down the hill with him while we went up the hill. He told us he knew what to do but he would not let the people in, so he let us go along. We stayed till late night, with my friend and he was off in the back of the pack with the group at the end of the day. When we got back we had to get him a big bottle of vodka. He drank it all up until his head shot with water, so he told me to get back home and say hello and bring him back, but he didn't do so, so he and we went over his camp. He told me it looked good that we were safe, but I was afraid of what he was going to do if I took a drink. So I said, "If I take a drink, let me know what you think of me." The next morning he told me he thought we were very funny. He was telling me that it was all great, and I said, "Ok, you won't say anything about the camp and the whole thing, but you've been so nice to me." I told him it was amazing how he could put a smile on my face and let me know, in a very good way, what h...
316|I'm a teenager, in my early 30s. A 20-year-old and a 50-year-old. I'm a young man's boy and a 20-year-old's man's son. It was a very difficult time. He was sick. He was at the hospital. He had two doctors there, and they were doing a really good job. So, I just went up to the front of the room to tell him that he needed to hear a good, good and complete story. And then I left to get to the doctor. He said, "Mom, what's going on?" I said, "It's not something i've understood. My whole life i've been involved in a lot of horrible things. But I know now what my life's going to feel like." And he had to hear a great story about his father. And he knew what it actually was like to be a father to a 10-year-old boy. And so he started to take my story very seriously.Gross: so, the story became so well accepted for some, it became such a sensation. What was it like going through what you saw?Juliano mccanna: well, this is actually the third time i've worked on a story with a 10-year-old and a 12-year-old. These are stories that have taken on such an enormous importance within society, whether it's the war tha...
317|A couple of years ago, something happened, and all the men, their wives and children had been slaughtered by the germans. The germans began to exterminate jews, and it began to happen. Some of them, even many of them, had to be slaughtered. They would have to eat the bones of others. Some of the men would have to be killed, or they would suffer the worst. They had to go to the slaughterhouse for their flesh. And on the way, they would die. So, I'm glad that, in that case, the jewish people and their neighbors and even the people who died in the holocaust were the ones who needed to go to the slaughterhouse. Even my daughter, who had been raised by the jewish people, was there at least in the moment when we started coming into a different country. At least I was there. I was there at the time. I was a young woman and my parents died in the holocaust. I was in my 60s, and my parents died in the holocaust. So, I'm glad that the people, those men, I am very glad that i, my whole family, has lived, and has lived, and has lived and done.Q. Why are you so proud of your ancestors, their children, you know, even the jewish people.A. Well, all the men who were brought up, all the children of the jews who were murdered and all the women of the jews wh...
318|One of my patients asked me what I thought the most important question would be if I was in a position to speak. I said that at a time like this it is not possible to speak without having a mental background. My experience was that all you have to do is be in good mental shape.The doctor told me that there are some people in the community with severe mental illnesses who are suffering from a life of suffering. It is not common to hear stories about how someone who has a mental illness is suffering and they are not willing to come forward.So for the first five years I was able to give a living talk to some young women here and I also spoke to an adult. The last few years I have spoken with a young woman who is diagnosed with an illness that affects her emotional and physical well-being.It was like that a few years ago. At the time, everyone was telling us that it is not easy. The first step is getting your head around what you are doing. It was like being a child to me. My mother went to the doctor and said, "You might be thinking of something really important. And you are." But we didn't think it was. I was still struggling, I was still young, and we were still young.A person who is in a position of power, control, power in the world and this is why there are so many people who make decisions like mine. I think most peopl...
319|It was not my fault, I had to be honest. I just really don't think people realize what a disaster that has been. I think it's all about your self-worth. I just really don't think that people take it seriously enough.If the word "Failures" Makes you feel bad, that's because I don't know how much it helped me cope with it. People often tell you that there "Just weren't enough things" To worry about. So how did I deal with the pressure of writing for these people?I didn't know what to expect. They asked if I was ready, and they asked about the book, and it was really embarrassing. I was scared. I remember the first time I had heard such a thing, and I think I was just terrified of that. I mean, I wasn't even sure if I was going to do the book or not.I had just finished the second book and I got asked if I was ready because they asked me if I was ready for my other books. They were just kind of asking me, what's the point of all this? I said that I was waiting for my family. No way. I didn't know any better. I really wanted to try it, but I was also just not sure what to expect. So when I said "Why didn't I already try it," I was like, "Why did you do that, you should've done i...
320|I remember going to my favorite place, one of the many great places in america, and sitting in the same room and talking to my brother. He came up to me and told me, "Can I tell you some stories?" And I said, "I really want to. I really want to." And we started talking, and he said, "Why don't you do that? Tell me you see what I saw and see what I didn't see." And that's when I started telling stories. I began telling stories. The first thing I said to my brother during that time, I said, "Tell me which one told you the story?" And he said, "Well, that one said, 'i did see your dad with a baseball bat.'" I told my brother how I had seen my dad. I said, "I don't want to tell you another story about my dad and I don't want to tell you what happened to the baseball bat." So, that was one of the first things I did tell him.And I went back and told my brother's story, and he said, "Well, you've got to tell me what happened to the baseball bat."So, that was a big moment for me personally and it's been a great experience for him and his family, personally. He's gone through that, he's been through this. It's been pretty amazing.The thing that was particularly difficult for him, wa...
321|I was standing in this room when I heard them saying, 'we're going to attack you.'"I went in and I saw them. I started doing what many people do in these situations, but it was this little scene where they were just completely out of control. This whole movie, this little scene where they were all in this room, they were all staring at each other. It was all so very disturbing. It is absolutely impossible for any one person to know what's going on.It's not uncommon for people to get away with that in a movie. It's even more so for a movie about a terrorist attack or a gangster or a serial killer. It's just so much harder to avoid the scene where you go down in front of a gun. That scene, when they just start to lose their temper, I have to say, is the one that struck me. It was so horrifying. It was hard to keep my eyes open. Especially since I was in the right place at the exact moment.You were never at the same place.I was standing next to a guy who was holding a baby or something. He was holding my friend's child back from the wall. You know, we're two people, and he was holding a baby, he was holding a child, he was holding his friend's baby back from the wall right from the start. And then he started yelling, and then he started screaming. And ...
322|I was the first guy to go on the boat with a boatload of boys and get some girls off. They were not taking us for a ride on the boat, and they were making us work for them. So when I got off I realized that they were taking me for a ride on a boat. And I was feeling like I was in the wrong place.I knew I had it, because I was on a boat. I was a little bit worried, because I was going to do a little bit of a rescue for the boys and all of the other kids. Some of them were looking forward to a long ride back home. So I said, 'i guess I'llsee them.' I had a lot of fun. I mean, I made it all the way to the boat and I just couldn't get off. I didn't know what to think.I was in a lot of pain.You know I'm still trying to get him off of the boat. I'm trying to stop his mouth from bleeding. I'm trying to try to stop his breathing out. I know I didn't do anything wrong. The last thing I want him to think or do is, 'i was right.'I know he's not angry, because he's a good man. He never said anything horrible.One of the boys, who didn't know what hit him, said it was the boat.I don't kno...
323|i took a call in mid-august 2013. I was on the phone just going over the phone to see if I had any luck in getting any information from a public relations firm or whatnot.I did. I contacted david. He said, "Hey, you want to try this?""Oh, hell yes. I hope you have some info about me from my own family.""I'd like to know how I got there."I went back to my initial call. A man was in his mid-30s lying across the street from me with a bottle in his hand. Someone was just standing there as I approached, looking at me from behind. He looked out and said, "You know," Before putting the bottle in his hand, and began to talk about what I said."He's making a big fuss about all this," I later learned. "He likes to be quiet. That's not your real thing."And then the next thing I know, the caller who actually called me was a guy with a long black eye, one of the only visible signs in my eyes. He asked me if I saw or heard anything. I told him I'd gotten in touch with him and had a good conversation with the police about these things.But then he told me I should get an appointment at a hospital.I didn't even have them pay for the day...
324|the day we got married, our dad got in a taxi and took us out to have some drinks. We told him we had a baby and we were happy with the results. The next morning we had a baby.The next day he called me and said he needed to know what was going on. I was shocked and he said, "We are so happy. Let's get in the car and drive."My mother was in the cab and he said, "I don't know what's going on. Let's move on. I have a son. We know you're in a very happy relationship. Let's make sure you're happy."He was very passionate about it. It was just incredible. He was very emotional and very kind. He was so kind to us. He was very open. He was open about giving up on us. He was open about his feelings and his thoughts. He was open and caring and very loving. He was open and very compassionate.We needed him to be there with us when we needed him. He was a very caring person. He was very supportive and caring, so very kind. I would say you want to keep your feelings separate. You don't want your feelings to be so separate from his. Keep it so real and make no apologies, but let it go in. Remember all you need to do is be supportive and open.The next morning, the next morning...
325|I was working at a local coffee shop, and a friend of mine brought us some coffee – I didn't want to use the words, "It's all coffee, everyone should try it"."So I went and bought a little bit of it and we took our kids to school. They told me that they were all very happy. It was great. And then I got an email yesterday saying that there was a friend of mine who was working at this place and that he just wanted me to order more than I had already. And I said, "Well that's just my friend and now I'm taking a break". And all of a sudden he said that he'll help me order more than I had planned. And I didn't want him to do that.So the next morning I made the order, which was the first one. And so that is when I went back to my laptop and was reading in my journal. And then I said, "It's a story I'lltell you, that is so weird".I thought: "What are you talking about, man?" And then I remembered that the other guy had said the same thing."And I just got up and said "You know, the people that work at this place are making my coffee". So that's when I said, "Ok I can get it here or I can get the coffee to my friends". And I thought you would like the coffee and I wante...
326|One day we got the news that the first ever police officer was shooting people. It was a day that was very different than what we were used to for that day. We had no idea it was coming. There was very strong fear that something was about to happen. A couple of weeks later we were informed that the shooter, joseph wray, was on his way back from a meeting. He was shot, the shooter was dead, and he killed a very beautiful young woman. We didn't know what to think. We all thought, "This is going to be a good day for new york!"We never knew what might happen to them. Why would we take matters into our own hands? We didn't think they would come to see us, but we did. It was so tragic, and it just took a lot for us to realize that these young men and women were doing something right. It was heartbreaking. We saw the young people as heroes, and we saw them as heroes, because they had been told they were doing something brave of them; we had seen them in action. People knew them. People knew what they were in action for.We were just starting to feel it on our own. It just took a lot of courage and a lot of persistence for us to know that, the only way to stop this is with guns. It wasn't easy. But that's exactly what happened.We were the first. Now that it'...
327|I'm 19 years old, and my father is a professional basketball player at florida. I was playing in the ncaa division ii tournament for the florida state seminoles that year. Coach mark foley decided I was going to go to the aau tournament. I felt like I was going to lose my head. It just didn't make sense. So I was like, "Ok. I'm going to go to the aau tournament and compete and be the best of the best and hopefully go to a tournament as great as college basketball." And then I was like, "Ok." Right. And that's something i've always been very proud of and proud of. [laughs.]as a result of that decision, I was really proud to go to the aau tournament for my freshman year. We played well together and I was able to hang out with a couple of guys who weren't there, like jeff gardner, the head coach. And my father-in-law helped me do that. And my dad helped me play with jeff (gardner) the whole time. And I just came from a lot of other places and was able to grow up as a basketball player and get involved in the game.But as a freshman, you had your head coach, mark foley, and then a couple of guys (mike d'antoni, zach lowe) that were going through this transition. They were really excited about it so much, but there were ...
328|I live in pennsylvania. I grew up in a small town that has a big football team that plays all over the place, which is about 150 people, and it's an old college town. I'm not really an athlete, and i've never played a football, so I didn't really get into the football world. But I was a student on the football team and it's a pretty big town and I got to play in there. But because of my high school history I got married and I was raised in a small house with a guy that's an accountant and i've done a lot of housework since then but that's never really been my life. So I moved to the big town a little bit from my small town in pennsylvania and came back for college football and I ended up going to penn state to play and win an fbs championship. It's something I never really thought of. I wasn't really even aware that I would go to an fcs school like that, and I think it's pretty fun in some ways. I think it's more of a sport. It's not really something that people really think about or care about, or have really come to know about. I think there's maybe a lot of that in college football and I think it's kind of a little bit of the american version of "Oh, that'll be like it at home."How did you feel when you got asked about the question?I was kind o...
329|when I was 16, I was just playing rugby at the same time as a kid. For me, the only reason I was playing rugby at that age was because I was a really good athlete, and it was really hard to get an education so I took those lessons seriously.I was also really, really scared by my mother, and my brother too. So, when I started to get into rugby football, it was something I never thought I would ever get before in my life. There was some other side to it. I got to play the game that I liked the most.I've always loved the game, but i've also spent hours every single day learning how to play. So it's really challenging to learn. And for me, going in to the world cup was an absolutely amazing experience.It was fun because you just go out into the community and learn about life and what it's like to be part of something that's been around for a long time and try your hardest to make progress. When something like that happens, it's like… you never get that love that you got from the game and just go, "Wow, this is incredible. I can do that!"What you're trying to do is make sure that you're not only doing my best, but that you are doing this for my sake.And I think that's what you do well.Thank you.Related link...
330|My brother was really bad at basketball. And then we went to a hotel and he made some terrible decisions in basketball. His father said to me: 'he's not going to play basketball again.' It was a big decision for my brother. I had no idea what would happen. My mother was just very angry with him. I thought, 'what's going on?"That's how much I learned about his life.It was a different world and I was in different places. I had to leave, I had to learn from my friend. It was a time of struggle. He was a genius in his own right. He was just so gifted. He was an intelligent student of the game. He knew nothing but he wanted to be a player. I was really in a strange place when I met him.But you can't win forever.We had to get out of there and we were like family, too. It was so different to stay in such poverty. When I was 19, it was so bad, and I didn't even want to stay there for 24 hours at a time. It was like an all-consuming hell. My mom had me do drugs, I got into fights, and there was food, so I was always hungry, but not really prepared for the big game. But you really have to start from the bottom.In my time in college, every year was just miserable and horrible. We were gettin...
331|I'm the kind of person who has to tell the story. I don't care who you are. Let me tell you a story about my little girl. She's just like me. I just want to please you.It was her first year in high school because she had just finished her freshman year in school and she was doing well in school. She'd been going to school and had just finished the year on a scholarship because she just loved football. She didn't have any family to come back to to play with in the offseason. She played out of school and never knew what was going to happen.She just wanted to be a mom.So I just wanted to just play. Now she's the kind of person that would be like, "I want to go to college," And I'd like her to play football. I don't know whether that's because you've got to learn to play football or you've got to learn to play golf, but she's the kind of person who really listens to the listener. When I was watching her, I'd say, "So you're the kind of person that would make a comment like, 'you know what, I just read an article out of your mouth saying you have to be a pro football player.' But I didn't know if she actually heard that. So I guess I just wanted her to get to know that she was the type of person that would make a comment like that...
332|My friend and I were on our way from our hometown to a meeting in the desert. A friend of mine and I walked up and over to my friend's house on the other side of the road. He walked around on the other side and started talking about how much he hated the military. He wanted us to think that it's a bunch of bad guys that make our society worse. I said to him, "You know what, maybe you had better think for a moment. You know what? You better go tell the truth," And that happened. This is what made it so that he gave up and stayed by his side.I was at that meeting and a man came up around me, he came looking for us, a bunch of guys in dark suits and holding the weapons. I didn't know what he was looking for, but that man told me to look down the list and I did. He said, "I think we ought to go down there and see what the guns are." I said, "You don't have to, don't know what the guns are," And I went down there and he looked at me and said, "What are you talking about? What are you talking about? I'm gonna kill you and take your rifle and I'm gonna shoot you. You shouldn't have to look like that, either." He said, "No, you have to be stupid." I said, "I want the rifle, I want to b...
333|For this reason, I was a little afraid to tell something very big about the world in the first place, because I knew I would get too much of it."The man then continued, "Then I saw all of the beautiful things going on on earth. I was really afraid.""You knew it too," Harry said, and the man laughed a little. "I had to give you permission to keep your mouth shut, because I thought you might want to ask a lot more of me. That was one reason why we were able to make it work.""I am not so sure," Harry said. "It is still too late. As it turns out, we are the only ones alive who are able to save us from a possible future where all the other lives are taken.""I want to get back to you. I am trying not to spoil any of the fun, or anything.""Oh, I could be as good as you," Said harry. "You are my best friend.""You were such a great student," Said the man, and he laughed a little. "I never thought I would be a little jealous.""And how could I not, once I saw your face?" Asked harry."Well," He said, "I was just about to say, 'i love you.' I was just thinking about trying to get to know you, in a totally different wa...
334|A story, you're probably thinking, 'i haven't seen a movie like that.' It's like, 'oh, so, you just didn't know that?' And you realize, 'i didn't know that.' And you wonder, 'that's because I don't believe it.'"As for the film's title, that makes sense. The screenplay was written by tom mccarthy, and, even though his credits were given to his son, he does not recall seeing the film, which was originally due march 20, 1994. To avoid spoilers, I'llsave all of the details for the full story, including characters and locations."We didn't realize we were getting something very different from 'the martian.' Because we have to do this movie to bring it back to life," Says mccarthy. "And so it's a great story. It's funny. It's beautiful to watch. It's a great story. It's brilliant. It's very well told and absolutely beautiful. We have to make this movie in the world of science fiction, and so we're all in this together."The movie, which also stars william shatner, also has a number of similarities. As he notes in this interview, both have been working on a tv series called "Sesame street" For years. As part of the show, shatner and his collaborators had an idea for how to make something more than a series called "Sesame street....
335|I think it probably goes something like this, and then I'llsay, ok, you've got to do something about it, and you've got to get the kids all to themselves. So, you've got to be so much more than that.Rocky: well, I mean, I was at her house one evening when I saw that it was going to be the night her son came home. And I didn't say anything. I took her phone. And when I tried to call her, I had no idea what she was going to do. I thought maybe she was on her way to her job. Or maybe she was at work too, or maybe she was out in town. But she was there, I think.And, you know, I felt like it was a good idea. And I took her to her and I took her to my bedroom and tried to call her, and I said, "You know, she's on her way." I thought I was doing it right. And my daughter, I think I told her, "You know, we don't know, but it was important to me that she said she was going to come back in a little bit of an hour or so." And her daughter, I think she said, "Okay."Rocky: well, if that's what she's saying, it's a good thing, because it's probably a good idea. It would be great fo...
336|In 2008 you had a friend who worked at the us state department—a us ambassador to iraq. Before that, he had been working with the iraqi government. He was on the frontlines, and he was dealing with people who were very important to that government. And he was very impressed and surprised by these people. In this role, he thought that they were the right people to help them. And they are very good people. You are doing well in the state department. The situation is not a good one, they say. And that's when things got weird. One of the people you were working with, and I know you know a lot about iraq, is tony blair, who at the time was secretary of state—amy goodman: and he was in his office.Stephen cooper: yes. And he had never met the iraqi government, I imagine.Stephen cooper: that was the first I heard of him. The first time he spoke to me was in february, he made a promise to the american people, not in public, but he promised them a way to avoid a nuclear war. It was not in public, you know, but he said he would give it to the iraqi people. And it was not a good offer. And we were getting really nervous—amy goodman: no, no, he wasn't willing to give it to the iraqi people.Stephen cooper: h...
337|a couple of years ago I was working on a project on the internet at a technology conference. I heard the news that google glass was taking off and I thought of all of my friends who have used it to watch commercials for the google logo on tv or play games. At first I thought it might work, but I never got the idea to see such a big difference between the way they look and how they interact with google glass. I thought they would all be amazed.I was in a lot of meetings looking for ways to make it easy to share your content with others. My idea is to allow people to share things that are not necessarily in common but shared in ways that are really personal to you.So I thought about making google glass a little bit more personal. We can take a look at how things are done at the office — in the office, in the hotel room or in the office suite. I'm not going to go into all the ways the company does it but I think it looks so good in the office that I think I'd want to share it.And so I thought about it: what should I put on it? What should it help with my research or that research? And so I tried to use the google glass button to show me a little picture of what it would look like. This isn't a simple project.It's actually pretty simple.It would look like this:now...
338|My first husband was a truck driver. He drove from one place to another in a truck in our own van. I've never been in a van before--we weren't even born. He drove a different van. He had eight children. So I was a good kid. I thought he was a good guy. It was a whole world of joy to have a kid that way, even after he was born."This story began a long time ago in my home state of wisconsin, and has been the subject of countless articles and stories on all of the major media outlets. I'm sure you'll agree with me that it has never been the fault of the media. It happened more often that this, of course, is the case. Yet today there are some, like former senator john mccain, who insist that I have made it a point to go down to the polls every night to cast a ballot for a candidate who will not only bring forth the support of the republican base at large but be the very antithesis of the american dream.As the new york times wrote about two weeks ago, when he was asked if he considered running for president, mccain said that he was "Not going to run for the same candidate." The new york times's nick gillespie did a similar thing two days later, when he asked whether he was "A man of integrity."The story gets worse, though, when the press and politicians who are currently trying to help president donal...
339|i just want them to know, because I am sorry to have to tell them that.I have a family, a family that's been devastated, and I am still grieving."I was born in this country, and I have been born in the womb.And this is where I got my heart broken.I lost my home.I lost my marriage.I lost my husband.I lost my partner.So I do not want them to understand.We are not going to do our best to talk to them.They will understand, because they will see the tears in their eyes.They will see the sadness in my eyes.They will see the frustration, the anger, the frustration in my eyes.And they will see the pain, the pain in my eyes.They will see it all the time when they see my face in the mirror or the light on the tv.And when they see me, they will see it all the time too.So we will not ask them any questions, we will not get their permission, we will just give them to say what they will never want to hear.We have no business to get people's opinions on things.We are not going to give them that.There are people who won't like me.They will think the...
340|When we were young, we were allowed to have a lot of fun playing with our friends and that's why we got it on dvd. Then, the next thing you know, we are playing in all-girls clubs together. We have no idea how we are going to go down this road.You have no idea what the story is about until now. There is a lot of misinformation about how the band came to be and what the plan was. How did it all go from there?It's all too personal, because when you talk about my wife, the name that makes my wife weep is the one i've always used to call the bride. I never expected her to be the bride. I never expected her to be the most beautiful woman in the world. But on the face of it, I think that was the whole point of the band. We wanted her to be our bride and that's why we started working with her and what we're trying to accomplish here. We don't want to be the kind of guys that have three kids and start laughing at one another. We want to be the rock stars that nobody ever saw us dancing, that all the guys are, and we don't want to be the last one singing us a song. That's what all those girls got to do. You put your foot down and you can only hope.We love the song "Get a girl from the bottom" Because there is so much fun t...
341|There was one night in the summer that was an evening where the kids were playing. It was a little bit of a break. This woman, there's really not one word about this, but I'm pretty sure she's a very nice lady. The whole story is, she was a friend of mine, one of the first girls I ever dated. We had never been to a girl's house, so she walked by her couch to play with the kids. It was a good story, she was nice and just had a good time. After that she looked out the window and saw that everyone else was playing again, and she said, "Hey, let's go play." It was a very good game. When I got home and she left, I walked back across this road at a fairly high rate of speed. I didn't know what to do. All I knew was, my husband drove over here, he said, "Hi, what's going on here?" I said, "Oh, my god, my god." I said, "I never knew." Then he drove up and said, "My god, I forgot to put the little blanket on your seat back there." A bit of a shock. She was probably just a bad girl at that time."When I was a young lady in my first marriage, she would often stop by my house. She had just given me her picture and put the picture down on the wall. I always got her attentio...
342|a couple years ago, for a long time, we were talking about how it all boiled down to these two kids:a couple years ago, we were talking about how it all boiled down to these two kids: the kids were too smart. They didn't like it when somebody else threw something at them on the playground. A couple years ago, they were having a lot of fun doing things because they were smart kids.I'm a pretty smart girl. I've always had a hard-earned sense of humor. I like to think that when I was younger, I was smart. I would walk by the playground. I'd try to put my hand on the playground to pick up the children. There was nothing I could do about it. When I was 10 years old, I would make a play of a board with my head on the end of a board. I would put my hand on the end of that board and say, "This is the board I want to play with you on." I thought, "Wow, this really is going to be one of the fun things for us to do. What if a kid didn't make it?" So I made up a piece of paper and played with it until it reached its end. And I was really into it.It has been such a long time since i've been doing that. I've been playing with my kids as a kid; it's like a family. And i'v...
343|in a story of the last few days, we were at a convention in washington, d.C. Two days before, we had a massive fireworks show, and the event was in washington dc, and it all happened in new york. We had an awesome event, but one of the reasons we left new york was because we had to get a new home. A lot of people were coming home from the convention, and they said to the guys in washington dc, "Don't leave new york, it's the big show, we need you, and we have to get you there. We need you now," And they wanted to come back. And the first couple of days, they had to get here in time. They had to go for hours. So we went.But it turned out that the guy at the convention had some of the best fireworks ever. He had a great show. He brought in a variety of people from the local scene, a few from the big cities like baltimore, new york, and chicago, and he brought in an awesome performer, a giant fireworks box. He put a huge show on top of it, and I took him to the show and his performance was a real winner. He was all over it.And the crowd was very excited. As soon as the fireworks went off, a huge amount of people came in and they said, "Hey, you got an awesome show. Let's go get it!" An...
344|I was born into a family of jewish immigrants. Now I'm about 30, I'm one of the most influential children in my family. What we were told in our early days that I was going to take care of my mother. You know, that was how they used to speak to me. It was true. But for some reason my family didn't believe it. And the second generation of generations of jews was in the dark about it. So they started to talk about it when they came through the system. What it was doing was, it seemed like there was going to be a new jewish culture in this country. I was born into a family who would tell us that.The first thing that came to my mind was that we should stop the government from sending us jobs. And we've been going about this like this for the last 25 to 30 years, we've been going about that. So we've said all of this, we've said it all the time. And then people don't understand. We're living in a country that has a record number of people who are unemployed, but that record number of people who were in the job market are saying to me, "What's wrong?" "What's right?" "What should I do?"We've been in this for a long time. And so, we're in a job market where there are people who need jobs. They're unemployed, but they are coming in and they're looking fo...
345|It is like if I were to see a white male guy in a suit, black guy in a trench coat with an american flag on his chest, but he was so cool looking and so white. He told me this story, because he knew the story was not going to happen. I know this is not true because he was so cool looking. But that's part of the story. I thought I must tell you that about the black guy in a trench coat. He tells me that story, he does not realize that he was telling the truth about himself. He doesn't realize that he must be honest, because he has become so cool looking, he knows now if a white guy was to start this conversation as a white guy, it would be over. Now I know who said it, but when I think back to the very first conversation I have with a white guy, I am very afraid I will die because of it. So one of the things I told white guys who I knew were the same things white guys knew, and I told them about the story of black guy in a trench coat and so on. I feel like in the future, when you meet white guys and they are white guys, you will not understand the story that white guys are telling, because white guys are still white guys. So what I want people to know is that when black guys are talking about the story of black guy in a trench coat and so on, they don't mean that black guys ar...
346|We were going into a big group meeting at my school to try to work on a novel with a lot of friends. After a while of brainstorming, I decided to make the novel a little bit more interesting for them. I wrote the story as part of a trilogy of events which were being planned out at different times in the past, and to keep the story as fresh and interesting as possible. This gave me time to prepare a little piece of paper to put together a list of the events leading up to the meeting in the first half of the novel and also have it prepared out by me, myself or someone I trust. I knew that there were many characters that I wanted to write and also wanted to make sure that it would be a little more relatable for them. The idea of writing an original story didn't work out in the end because I was still in the midst of a series of plot-lines that I had to make up in the novel and had to take a break from it, so I had to write it in between the events in the story that was happening and just focus on what needed to happen at that time. It was a very difficult assignment, and I don't think I ever would have been able to write one if not for writing the story out of an original script. I had to make it a lot more interesting for the people involved than I ever could have been able to do in a novel. I tried to get the story as relatable to the...
347|For the past 15 years, i've been a professional basketball coach in seattle. I've coached several teams, from the lakers to the timberwolves to the suns. But i've never been a regular on one team's roster, even though i've played 14 seasons here. I've never been called upon to play on the national stage. My team has always been one of the best in the country -- and I know it."And in my second year as a coach, I found out the truth. I learned a lot and didn't try to change anything. But I had to. It was very difficult for me.He's going out there every day working very hard for his team to win games, play great basketball and get that trophy, not win it on sunday.(mick zimring, espn)"You can't take it away from that. It was devastating for the team and for the coaches. I felt like I could play and win one hundred times by my game every single night and play a lot better. But when you're doing that, you have to accept that."But the truth is, when you go to a game, you have to have respect for that game plan. And I know I know it wasn't a good decision. But when you're sitting there waiting there because you've never been called on, you have to have respect for that game plan."Now, i'...
348|One afternoon in 1999 I was with a friend who is a teacher in a school here, who is from south africa. We were talking about race relations in education, and he was telling you about a recent case that was just announced about the racial attitudes of students in the local school. I just thought he was very kind and helpful. He just wanted me to sit down and talk to you about it, and it's an interesting story. He said, "Oh, I saw some footage of the school recently in south africa. There are all kinds of stories about this school, and this has been a horrible thing to see, and the black community has been saying that is not a good thing. It is not the right thing or the right thing. It is, well, a good thing to see that, but there's also some really bad things. Now, how will this teacher be treated by the community and the government?" The government said, "Well, they're going to take it to courts to try and find out whether it is a good thing or a bad thing. But we do have a legal opinion that is on the other hand. That is, you are here to go down the path of rehabilitation." So we got this great team of people working from the community who were kind, helpful but kind and generous and a big role model for me in that, so I had a lot of fun doing that.And I think I'lltell a story later about wha...
349|I was in the middle of a fight with a guy who was in a big restaurant and this guy had his hair combed. He was talking about how the food in his restaurant was a little bit too sweet for him. We sat down and he was like, 'you don't understand anything about your food, do you?' I said, 'yeah', and he said [to himself], 'well, I guess I'm going to take care of that.'"With his hair combed, the one thing they all agreed to was a "Good" Meal.Gunnock has spent most of his career with mcdonald's. His first book, the great new american meal, was published in 1984 and was the first major book he released on the topic. However, he has since sold more than 10 million copies.In 2010, the company released the movie "The great american meal." The movie was a sequel to the original, the great american meal which starred kevin hart, john cusack, james dean, and woody harrelson. The movie also stars peter dinklage and david oyelowo...
350|I think that was a real disaster. I think that's not fair to anyone. But this is the kind of thing that everybody does when they see a movie where they try to get out of it. I mean, they do it because you see them, they're kind of in there, you like them, they're in there. They want them to come back there to do it. We'll see, and we'll learn and we'll see. Maybe there are people out there who are too hard on them.So, in that example, I think the people that we have in this office are going to be the best of us.And, as you know, I'm very close with people. They are very close. It's just the nature of business, and it's not all about who's the brightest, or who's the smartest...
351|Just three days ago, we had an explosion right at 10:30 p.M. Local time. Our firefighters called the police. The blast tore off our doors, but the fire truck was parked nearby, and we were waiting to take it to the local police station.When we got there, my buddy and I were holding onto the door. We were trying to get into something. We grabbed the ambulance, and then when ems arrived, we got out and we were taking care of our little guy. So we immediately took off running, and then we took off, and that's when we started getting shot.At one point, my buddy was going to make sure his sister didn't leave. We ran back. We ran over to the truck. They told us to go over there and we did.After about an hour, I got shot. So many bullets that the paramedics say, "I don't want to see you alive." They had to give us an ambulance. We put another bag of bullets in the back seat and we were waiting outside to go take our kids.I still have one bullet left in me. We're hoping that other people will tell us about this. We're hoping that people are going to call the police and say if you know you've been shot and that's that, it's that day. I'm sure that you will tell us about what happened that day. It's so good to see the firs...
352|Some of the people in the world who know my name are friends with the clintons. So many of these people have ties in their own family business. But they have no connection to the clintons. And because they don't have anything to do with our campaign, they are never gonna have any money on their side.Amy goodman: so what exactly are the people in the crowd trying to do?Mary daniel: well, the fact is that these people have been working for so long, at a very high level, that they have no idea what's going to happen during the election. And, you know, some of them have been trying to get the democrats to give amnesty to millions of illegal aliens and to bring back all of the jobs that were lost. And others have taken advantage of our tax cuts to help them pay for their own campaign, and other people have been giving speeches at every stage of the campaign to show them who won. There are a number of folks in this crowd who are getting paid to do the work of the clintons, and others who want to get the money back. But we are being watched. I mean, we do have people in different parts of the country like that that want to do work for the clintons. Some of the other people who come down the hall with me are doing things in favor of the democrats, and some of them are supporting the democrats, but most of these people are sitting over here doing nothing.

353|In 2002, my brother passed away from pneumonia, and my mother was able to send me to see him at home. I went to see him in the united states, and I was given the diagnosis of pneumonia by an american doctor I knew. I was informed that I would be unable to leave colorado until I had treated my brother for pneumonia. I was so desperate that I had to travel all the way from denver to colorado, and I had to get home with my wife and my two young teenage daughters. So, I went to see him here in chicago, and he gave me the diagnosis of pneumonia. We went to see him a few days later. I don't recall all of the details. I've told you about my mother's experiences with pneumonia. I am afraid that I am not going to get through this. I will not tell you what I do have heard about my mother or my brother and my brother's illness. I will tell you that I have tried to make it through these experiences. I have told you about how many times I came to the emergency room to see my brother. But, in the end, he was a little bit less than a minute down in the hallway. I don't remember how long his lungs were open until he was admitted. It was then we went to see the hospital.Now, let me tell you something: I'm a former student at the university of colorado, where I had a few years of experience as an educator befor...
354|A couple hundred years ago in a field of forested mountains in northeastern iran, a group of men arrived on an unsuspecting tribe after a hardy shaman had lost his life on the mountain. They thought they were some sort of gods, but in reality there was some evil cult that was worshipping those gods. One day a young child suddenly fell out of a tree trunk, but its head broke into three. He was left with three broken hands. He was taken to a small hospital, where the doctors treated him and his friends for three days. He came back and was completely fine. When he arrived, he discovered that his face is much better than what he had expected. He was able to use his head to read a book, but that wasn't enough to replace his lost face. He had to use his head to talk with the people around him, and that meant the people around him. Even though he could not read or write, he could read some texts and some simple stories. This was not an ordinary tribe. When they were in charge of their tribe and had a family, their children would come and stay, but this was not normal. This was not normal, this was a group of men who were coming from different tribes all together. They had to talk and have family relationships, and sometimes they would not even speak to one another. They would not be able to communicate with one another if everyone was talking from a distance. If one were to come and ask their leade...
355|The first time I saw it, I was so disappointed. A young boy came over and kissed me, and told me that he had asked his uncle's sister to make him his new father. He promised that his mother would be with him when he was seventeen, and he would go along with her to his parents' house. I was so moved by his words, that I asked the father if he would like to make a few bucks, and he said, "I'll do it." I didn't even know what he meant, but he did say he would take me to the house."The story of the two sons is a wonderful one. I was so upset when I heard those things about the family. I was so mad when I saw the little boy kissing his uncle so fondly. I was so embarrassed by my reaction that I called his parents with this story. I went home and watched the movie and told them that they could have found out what those two boys were up to. I don't know if the father and mother were really aware, but I think it was the idea of having no one on a farm when I was a child.The family grew up in a very poor family, which was very bad. They had no money, they have nothing, they grew up with no money and there was no food. Everything they had was put together for their own amusement. My father was not happy with their household. He told me, "Loo...
356|when mike and I walked into john ritz's apartment one night, they went to sleep in their beds. I took michael's phone, and we had to go through a couple of things. 1) the phone was on the other side of the room where the two of us lived. We took the phone. We walked downstairs to where john was in jail, he was just going through some paperwork. 2) outside was a bunch of people. He had just come out from work and was having a few drinks.I went up to him to ask him what was going on and I told him he had no idea what was going on. So, we sat down and I didn't want to go into details."Well, mike, I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you that he's going to tell you that. He's going to tell you that they're going to tell you that. That they're going to tell you that he's going to tell you that he knows you're not going to like it. And he's going to get you to tell him what she told you. And to tell you something. He's going to get you to get him to tell you this.I said, you know, I'm sorry."Mike, that's your mommy." I said, I'm not going to.He said, no, mike. "Well, tell me wha...
357|i got into real estate. My husband got out of school, I went to an abortion. I took two jobs before I ever took any other job because I had to pay for myself and my kids.I came out of the abortion business, and I went with a different kind of idea:i want to give back to the people who have helped to pay for my own children.I didn't do that because there has been some negative impact on me in different ways in the past. But it makes me think about it more as a person.I wanted to take a different position every day, and I did. I wanted to do it so that my children never have to struggle. It has been an amazing experience to be able to have the support of the families who have helped me pay my mortgage. There are still people who can't make it through the process. Just like when you go back out to the grocery store and you see a bag of flour that says, "Just give me that," Just because you've put it in a bag doesn't mean you can't make it again.I still have this feeling when I walk into my office, and it's like, "I took 20 years to get through it. I just want to take it back for what it was."The story of how I made my decision to become a parent and do this is important. Sometimes when we talk about getting married an...
358|In 2010, I walked in the restaurant and it was so delicious. You could not be more pleased.I went to work, I asked my manager what was the deal. He said, 'you have to have this one.' So I asked, 'what is it?' His response was what is it? The food? What's it called? There it was.And so, with this one being so great…the first question was, 'do you have the exact same brand as the ones you have?' And so, there was a huge difference.So, I looked at my menu, and I could not believe it, I just told it.And I'm not talking about the same as you, but the one that really made me happy was the grilled chicken.So, I know we had a lot of different items. I don't need to tell you that, because that was exactly what happened. For all of our menu, we had the same chicken.So, there, I went and bought it, and I said 'you had the grilled chicken? What's it called?' He said 'yes, it's the hamburger.' It's a hamburger.And my manager asked me what did I take away from that? I responded with, 'well, I took it out, but that's it.' And he said 'well, you just got rid of the chicken.' And ...
359|I met a girl who, at fifteen years old, would make a good doctor, and did so well at her job that she became quite wealthy, and I bought her my first house in brooklyn.I went to the school, and there was a man named arthur lee, who used the name george lee, and he was a very handsome man. I invited him to the school, and he sat down and said, "You know, i've seen a lot of people who have an extraordinary education." And I said, "Well, arthur lee, I hope that if you'll think about it." And he asked me if I could sit down for a minute--and then he took off his coat and said, "I don't suppose a hundred children can afford that kind of a person, and if they can't, there's no way I could get any more money than that. I mean, it's really a pretty good deal. And I said, "Well, let's just get through this together." And I said, "Well, i've got to get to my business by doing it, so let's go to my business." So he took off his coat and walked out of the room.You know, he got out of the room and said, "It's not my job, arthur," And he told me, "You're not going to help me any more." So he went to the principal--but he wouldn't take the jo...
360|I was a kid when it happened. I'd come home and my sister was on the phone with the guy that was walking around. She was talking to a friend that was trying to make some kind of money, and he was like, "Do you think you can make a living from it?" So, she's like, "Um, yeah. I'd like to take a job as a salesperson to make some money." So I was like, "I need to do some kind of work and maybe it would make a difference." So, I went through, like, 2 or 3 other business models i've tried for years. Because when you talk to people and they come up to you with the idea of taking a job as a salesperson, you think they're a little confused. But it's all really simple, because it's very easy to get a job at one company and to get a business or service and it's so easy to get something on a daily basis that's going to be a nice investment in your life.A friend of mine, in a couple months, I got a job at a local grocery store that ran on the grocery store business model. I was really impressed with the fact that it was very common for people to walk to a store and sit down and buy their food. I ended up buying everything at $9.99, and I thought it was really, really good. But then I was in grad school whe...
361|i've lived for 30 years in a small town in eastern massachusetts. The family I grew up in is a catholic church that is about 10 miles from boston in the center of boston, so when my father died when I was six years old, my cousins were there. My father would go to work at the time as a janitor. He'd go back home, pick up children and play hockey. I was in high school on a crossroad. I heard someone say, "How many people have been involved in this in the previous 12 years?" Then the car pulled up and I asked them who was involved. I had a hard time believing the answer. The next day, I was standing at the gate with a friend and looking around. I looked around for a minute, then said, "Where were you going?" The car pulled up behind my friend, and he came in and said, "He was in town for the holidays." I said, "I saw him, but I don't know who." I knew his name was james and he was in the house. I thought I was going to call the police." I told the police, "This guy is a serial killer, the shooter." I told the police, "You know who he is? He's been with this for years, this was a long time ago. He's been a serial killer for years, and I heard a lot of things about him in this town. This happened 20 years ag...
362|The first thing that I noticed when I was working at my high school was how quickly the student body was moving to the left side of the room. The student body that was at the right was moving to the right very rapidly. I think the first thing I noticed was that this wasn't even a thing. They were moving to the left side of the room as fast as they could. This was their second floor office, where they'd have a computer, which they put in there, and these two men had their computers on each side. They'd switch between three different computers. It was amazing. I was watching their computer, and people were moving. I'd say, "This is a great computer, but it seems to be missing something."After working with them for 10 years, what I remember most about your first experience at mit is how much of this was your own personal experience. They had people who were doing it as an agent of choice. They'd be working with computers for a certain term or whatever and you'd ask them their thoughts. They would think, "I know I'm doing this right now, how do I get this right?" I'd sit there and just walk along, and they'd say, "Oh, I'm not seeing the problem now. Why does this problem come up?" And I would look up at them, and I'd say, "Well, that's just the way that they are," And they'd answer, "Do...
363|I've spent three years as ceo of the world's largest and most expensive public transit (cta) company. As a child I was riding a streetcar, always with a family member on board. I was so excited that I was able to give the kids a ride on a public bus without being a passenger. They laughed at the fact that I wore glasses, but it wasn't enough. Instead I asked the kids to play with me, or to play on my lap at school. I was so excited that I asked my son to play with me. In an attempt to be my best friend, I turned the corner off one bus, and then ran for five miles, and I was off to my best friend's place at night. As soon as I left my hometown of seattle, I went off home.That is where this journey began. When I reached my home in northern california, I met with a friend who said she had had a bad trip and she had to come back. She would ride on the back of the bus to the hotel, and would do that the following night, after the kids were home.I had always wanted to ride public buses. I thought it would take a bit longer because I had to give up the family to go on the private bus. That wasn't something I wanted to do. Then I started thinking about private bus. My dad rode his private bus, but he was a great dad. His daughter would always ask hi...
364|i'm a photographer, I work for a local nonprofit and I'm a member of the national park service.In 2002, I attended that state championship game against the denver broncos. I didn't really recognize the name, did i? But I knew I had an idea. That was what I wanted to do.And I wanted to do it in a way that would feel like an experience, that would not be a waste of my time. That would be the most important thing to know on the play call, that I believed I had what it took. But I did it. And I said I'm going to go out and do something new. Something that would not be the same as the previous year's play call, that would be different.This year's play call was made for the new york giants versus the san francisco 49ers. I saw this beautiful scene coming out of new york—it looked like, from the first picture, as you can see, it's from the second picture. And I got goosebumps all over the place. That was awesome.And then, suddenly, there was this huge thing coming out of new york and the giants had just been eliminated. And that was the moment when the story of the moment began.So I started looking at the story and the game and then I thought, "I really want to put this into perspective." And the first question would be, "How man...
365|I have the very same feeling that my mother, my sisters and my cousins are going to have this conversation. I want them to look at each other in those eyes and say, 'how are you doing?'"But she didn't tell her mom why he was getting a new job. Nor would she tell her mother why he was leaving the church. Nor would she tell her mother why he was quitting.And yet, she said, he was still there."That's why you think I should quit," The mother said. "You know when you think about how much I am doing for my brother, you think, 'ok, that's enough.' I have to leave. It's my brother, and he's doing what he has always done for me."Dawn hockenberry was the church's last minister when she first became married late last year. She and her fiancé had been married until recently when one of their other longtime friends moved in."When I was 10, they moved in," Hockenberry said. "And I moved in to be with them, not to let them see me grow old. And a lot of times I felt like one of them was trying to destroy me. It was hard."Hockenberry has known several of the people who gave her an unexpected new look in their weddings. One of them was a woman who was a christian. "I knew that sh...
366|I was at a party, and there was a friend of my best friend. We were at a table and she had a bottle of water. She said, "Hey, you know how much you drink. I think your face should be red," And that was about it. I gave her the bottle. I asked her, "You know who you are?" She said, "No. What I do is I come back to visit you." And if you think I'm rude, I really am. It doesn't matter if I'm rude or not, I do what I say and you'll see. They are great people, the people that we are, I just don't know any better. So, let me tell you what I know for sure: I'm a total professional liar and I know full well that i've screwed you more times than you've known to be honest. I have to admit it; there's nothing that makes me more honest than lying. You know, when I told the story, I didn't mean for her to know about it. So I told her it looked like I was lying. So, she immediately started to laugh, and I told her I didn't mean to hurt her. When I was getting ready to go to bed, I looked at her. And she immediately laughed and said, "Yeah, so what are you laughing at?" And then I went to bed and she was sitting there with all her other friends. That's whe...
367|A man named james. He came to the house with a friend, and we went to his house to discuss this marriage. He asked me who he wanted to marry and I said it was me. James said, "You're going to marry me, I'm going to marry myself. I just want to get married." He was not an accomplished man. He had very little money. He wanted to get married. I said to him, "I'm just like you." He just said, "Who?" He said, "My name is john. I was trying to get married for a while, but I couldn't get married. I had to get married, and after I got married, I got married." So I got married, and we got married. Then, on january 6th, 1859, I got married to james womack at the new york inn. He was a real good man, very honest about his love for this woman. James wanted to have her marry him, and I said no. He said, "I can't marry you." So I said, "You do not want to marry me, for I have to find a mate for you, right now." He said, "You have no one." I said no. I said that I wanted to marry him, and I was very well-connected with the new york inn. He said, "Can I please marry you?" I said, "Sure, you can get one....
368|When I was 14 years old I decided to go to a high school gym for free and I had a workout that could change my life."I knew I wanted to do it. The idea was I would do this and do it because it was fun and made me feel like I was doing something great."I thought I was doing a good thing. I saw myself on mtv and I went from there. I was hooked."But it took some time and I was working a lot. I went on my first day with my friend and I had a dream to be a gymnast in college. I went to gymnastics school and I still have a dream in which I would finish gymnastics because of my career and my love of gymnastics."And I was doing well in the gym. It took some time and I was doing an incredible job. But I couldn't do it."So I went the distance again and I had done this for a year and I went to gymnastics school again and I was doing this and this. And I was doing what I had to do and it went on for a while."But I was still going downhill and that led me to make this decision."And so I went to work and my goal was to be a gymnast, and I did it."And when I saw it on tv it was in a show they were promoting fo...
369|The first time I looked at the website and saw the name "Virgil varnell" On it, I thought "I may as well do this now than wait until this one is added to the list." I went from "Virgilvarnell" To "Virgil varnell: varniferum."The next day, my email to the editor read:"Hi peter, i've been looking on your website for about 2 weeks now. I know I'm going to need to add something, but would your services be available to you at all times. I think this is a good idea of course. We have three offices in berlin, but I think they are really helpful.""Ok, I'llmake it available soon."After a bit of research into the website, I found that your service would include the following:a free, fully-flavored "Virgil varnell" App on windows, mac, linux and mac.A "Handful" Of free and "Free-in-app features for ios, android, kindle fire, xbox one, mac and windows.An "On-demand, personalized online chat program for everyone with no waiting."A "Free and hassle-free shopping service for those who love to get their hands dirty."A free "Tutorials site for learning about free and free-in-app programmin...
370|I'm writing a book about the life of one of the most important figures who ever lived in my life, my grandfather. I told you so in 1993. I'd been a journalist for a long time and I'd been interviewing people for a very long time and I figured I had some work to do to go to my grave and tell my story to my people. I had to learn about the fact that in the 1970s there were all sorts of events that put these people on this pedestal: some of these people were just dead, some of these people had died, some of them had been around for some long time, some of them were just people who were just living around, and some of them were just living and some of them were just surviving. And they did it. And when I came across this story, I thought in my heart that was an incredible piece of news, a phenomenal story. And, you know, I'm telling this now. And you know, I'm not the only one to do this. You know, I talked about a couple other stories about them. And they all had the same goal: to tell stories about other, different people who had died or were sick. And I have to say there were a couple of people who said to me, "You know, it's so interesting that you did it, you've got to tell this story." And he said, "Yeah, if I do, I'llbe the first person t...
371|I don't know anybody who had to put in the work of getting up at 7am. I didn't want to work late. I was bored. I wanted to go to london and spend the night. My boss saw me and said, 'i'm going to do this again.' It was a good way to work during the day and not late. And he went back to work and I said, 'yes, I will. You have to go.'"The whole project was a little bit of a rollercoaster. We were working for three months and in the middle of it, I had no money and I was worried about my time. I'd been working hard in the pub for a number of years and I wasn't going home for the summer. I felt that I was no longer a regular member of the pub. People came and said to me: 'are you kidding? You're the only one who's ever felt like you were going to get hit by a car in london when you were five years old.' I felt that I was getting hit by a car once because I had never been here before. Then, suddenly, I felt like I was going to be the hero. And so it was such a relief."I knew that I would do well in the team. The team is going to be in there for a while after the summer. We don't go so close to making the big move but our manager told me, ...
372|When I was in college, we were a group of students in a dorm. We had a group of about 2,000 people. At 10:00 p.M., we would get together to meet up at a dorm. I would have a really great time and we would go on the trip to see some other college girls and have a great time. They would tell stories and we would laugh so bad.We had a great time and I have a great memory. One of my friends told me, "When you do good stuff, you will be good as a person." I was like, "What?' He said, "Yes, that's right."I remember sitting at the table talking to one of my friends and he said, "What do you mean?" He said, "You have one of his stories."My parents were there, my friends were here. Some of us would go and get things. We were there for a while. I know it was a bad time because I don't remember the same things. I think we didn't really talk about what I did and still don't remember that.I don't think there was any sort of animosity of anyone. I would think that was the best time in my life. I didn't see anyone who was bitter, but this was not the first time that I had done this.We had been invited to a party and we had a party. It was a...
373|It wasn't like a lot of people ever read "Tangled" And thought, "That's just stupid." They just thought it was going to be something new. So we really knew what a fun thing it was, and then we kind of had to just try to keep it fresh and fresh because there wasn't even a lot of new information in that book."As you go through the book, as you read it, you see some interesting things that you can think of, but you don't think, "What did it mean to make this a novel that you couldn't have done?"That's what I wanted.For example, you can't be in a novel and say what kind of "Tangled" Is going to be.That's wrong.It's wrong because it is a novel of two characters. The one at the center is the one that can only be seen by a cat but the two at the end are the ones that can only be seen by the cat only. So by doing something like that, the two characters get separated.You can't have two characters be separated.It's kind of, like the character that you're in as opposed to the one that's at the center of your book.You know, this is the story of the two, because by doing it right, it creates more possibilities for you. It allows you to go on with the story and hav...
374|When I first took off for washington, d.C., I was a little shy. I had a few months off before I left then; by the time I arrived, I knew how much my hair didn't match my height. I was a little more timid than most people. A funny thing happened to me then that day as well.I remember watching the football game with my parents, both from my home town of seattle. When we got back, I was still so pretty and wore a long blond suit. When paul perkins was making the jump into the nfl, he said, "I think that's how I look. If you look at the pictures of my haircut, it looks sort of like a little kid. I'm a little shy for men that are very muscular. But my hair is pretty damn good." The way he looked at me after was pretty much what I wanted. If you look at photos of paul perkins, that is my hair. I can't think of a more typical person in that picture."Pierce wilsonwilson had his own hair, but he was quite handsome. You can tell that by the way he always wore black jeans and a red tank top. He had a long, flowing ponytail that had long been cropped to look like a headstock, short and thin, with a black band around the headline. In the 1980s, wilson was considered the perfect specimen for a show that was going to be broadcast o...
375|I started doing this podcast with a friend. He was so impressed with the work he was doing to promote the program. He was so impressed with the way that he was able to take the program and show his followers what it really was. And I'm just looking forward to it continuing to grow.Q- is there anything about psa it's really easy to copy? Or is it so hard to copy so much?A- so this is kind of like a great example of psa, because I would use it a lot in my writing. You know me and I'm the author of psa, and I was pretty well known in that book…q- so you're not using it as a copywriter?A- I'd never use it as a copywriter.Q- you're just using it to add flavor to the book, not to make it so that you could go over it.A- my goal is to make the book stand out. I think the book can get a lot of attention, but I really am taking advantage of it because people want to know, and I think the book is a great example of what if you could really write it with this kind of style.Q- and you have a lot of people wanting to check out the book and have people like you go over it, so I asked you for a quick question. So how did you get started with the boo...
376|i've been in business for 15 years, selling electronics and electronics accessories, and i've worked with great people. I've worked with people who got a real sense of what was going on behind the scenes, and people who were very knowledgeable and professional. I've worked with great people at various companies in the electronics community, in hardware, in software, and also i've worked in an environment that was very supportive of me.That's an amazing feeling. And yet, it's very difficult.And then you can look at it, in the digital world, and this is where most people don't want to work with us anymore. So they're going to have to buy phones, then they're going to have to use their computers to make all the apps, that's where we're at, and it's a really rough time. And there are also things that it's very difficult to get started, and it's not always easy, but the world we're in now is much more difficult.Let's start by talking about what happened under the direction of the new founder of oom, who's taken a different approach to the business, as well as to the business of oom. His experience with software is really great, and he's taken a very different approach. So there are some very positive things ahead for oom and people of any level who are going to like working together.One is that he doesn't like t...
377|My mother was the daughter of a wealthy indian husband and his wife. I always loved the story of her because, she was so young and beautiful at the time. He was quite an intelligent and brilliant man, but as a young man he wanted to get to know me quite a bit. My mother had a very high level of education but she didn't know much about education. So we knew nothing. She could speak only italian and english. But when I was about 7 she said to me: "You know, that would be a bit unusual, you know, I think I'm going to be asked to make some money." I said: "Ok, it's ok. I can work for you, I can go around the place." He said: "No, not yet, this is a long time since you left and now I'lltake care of you. It might be a bit late, but I'm ready." So we went through our first year of business and so we went through it again. We worked hard. We had to make sure everything went ahead with our daughter. The first year we had a total of 8 children. But we managed to raise six of them because we got married. We worked hard. We had to use the money on food and medicines when we were young. But we also needed to help our parents to keep the children on their toes and not worry about the money.The kids were very small. But they were very important...
378|We had breakfast together four years ago. We didn't really discuss anything because I was so bored and it was hard for me to concentrate on anything. But the next morning we have dinner together. The dinner is a big family dinner and we have quite a number of brothers and sisters and a lot of good things to do here. So a couple of months ago we had dinner together one night with a lot of our friends and it turned into a bit of a party. We had a huge appetite and it did turn into a little bit of a struggle. But my stomach is happy.Kathleen king: I see. You can ask your father to take you out for a lunch of some sort.Jesse kenningston: yes. I think the reason I was so proud to ask him to take me out is because I was very nervous for two years and a half and I didn't know what to do. You know, it was just just not realistic. We really don't know what we want to do, we don't know what our future has in terms of going against our parents. So I was quite surprised to see him come to me in person and say: "I'm sorry for the situation, but I'm sorry for having an affair with your sister and my wife. I've never had any kind of affair with my wife before, and I'm quite certain we wouldn't have had these two friends. I just hope that yo...
379|For the first five years, the family was in one of the best jobs in the world. They had a mortgage, they got a car. They had the job, and we were on the streets. The first thing they did was have a baby. Then all of a sudden we found out that there was a job that didn't exist. So that was kind of the first step we had to do. We thought it would be amazing to find a job that matched their life. They were working 15 hours a week at a mcdonald's that paid an average of $5.50 an hour, and our kids were up to $10 an hour. We thought we'd really like a job, but we were in such a bad financial position.I guess it's a little bit of a lie. I remember sitting in my apartment in la. I was thinking, "If it's going to work, they're going to make money. But if it isn't going to work, i've got to make a living."There's a big difference between living well and living poorly. I mean, there are all forms of income and all kinds of ways to earn those income streams. It's a very complex matter. I mean, you can have an income, you can have an income, go to work, get that kid. And for a lot of people, there are really no ways to do that.On how your career has affected your life...
380|one of our guests had gotten up in an ambulance with a lady. She was in need of a little help and was so tired she told us that if we wouldn't come we wouldn't go. They put a bag of food on top of her and they said that if she would stay here longer we would help her out with that. We all had to come when we could.The lady and we decided we would give it a shot. It didn't take long for it to be a success. It took only 20 minutes but by the time I got back to our hotel we were all dressed up in all our clothes. We told the hotel that we were going to do this after all the work that we got done. The lady told us that she was very sad to see me. "You know, i've only seen your face the last four or five times," She said. I said, "Well, you know what?" The receptionist told me that my father is a singer and we just asked her if he'd like to get together again to sing. She laughed. She told me about her husband. She said, "He has done more than most of us. He has been able to put aside his anger to come here." That was the moment when it was over for me.The next morning the receptionist came back with me to say, "Come on. You see you're so young. You're in the best shape ...
381|I'm 23. I was born around 1980. I'm 5'4", 220, with short brown hair. I was going on maternity leave. I was in a band. This band was called the dead heads and it was called the dead heads. It was called the dead heads. Then there was the rolling stones. My parents were very, very unhappy. My mother was still very unhappy. I don't know if she's ever gone through with what happened, what happened to me. But I guess that I may have a lot of stuff in my head that's been with me all my life. I have a lot of stuff in my head.Brock: I remember talking to you in your last interview with cbs. I remember, you talked about how this happened during your time as a rock and roll musician. You mentioned you were doing some sort of cover cover for rolling stone, and your family is there. What was a long time ago when this occurred?Mick: I know that I was not in a band at the time, and I didn't have any influence with the band. I heard that there was some controversy in that time. Like I heard a lot of the controversy over the fact that the cover cover for rolling stone was called it gets better.Brock: I'm going to ask you about that. But I'd like to ask you about something that happened when you first came around to rock and roll, and you sai...
382|I'm talking to the young american parents who have been the breadwinners of our country. They are not the ones with the kids and a college degree. They are the ones who got educated and were on the ballot this spring. And they think that it would make any of it better. But they have been lied to, they have been lied to, they've paid bribes. And they think they're being lied to for their vote by a group of people who think they are being told they are not.I know that you're a proud progressive, but I know that every one of us is working through this nightmare as a nation. Some of us have spent weeks trying to make good on the promise we made during the democratic primaries.But there are many, many more people who will suffer for this. And they're going to have to think about what to do so that they can help make a difference, not just in the presidential election, but in the future. The future doesn't matter much to them because they know their futures.But they're also going to have to think about what they can do to help those children and their grandchildren.It's not like I'm giving up hope in my life, because my life has been filled with tragedy. I've watched the devastation of hurricane katrina. I've watched the devastation of sandy. I've watched the devastation of the civil war, the fighting in gaza. But this is just a smal...
383|I was a junior to a high school teacher. As we were playing golf with the class, the teacher told the kids to leave the place and come back and let us go. I remember a long time ago he sent me with a small parcel of paper saying he knew where the place had been, or he would send me back to where we were. I felt like I owed him a little money, but when I went back to the place I found a sign that said "Get your money back."Then the family came to school and the teacher called the police.I never got the money. I didn't know there was any money there, so I asked him if they should send us into a hole and then say "No, we're not going to take you."Then he told me to leave and I did. When I got back, I was told that I had to take the paper. I didn't know what to do at first. I told them to come up to me, put my clothes on, take off my coat and I'd go back.I went back to see my parents. I could see they were distraught. I looked down at myself, and they said "We're not your parents. We're my nephew." I looked up at them and they said "Well I'm the one who did this." I said "Well that's why I'm here, and this is what I am." But they told m...
384|It started a fire in my head and then a fire in my wife. And I told her that. And they said, okay. What's the difference? They said she could use a car. And I said, okay. She said, the car was so good. She can do this. She can do that. She can do this. I said, okay."I was not at home when mrs. Obama came home and I said, "Well, let me know if I miss." She said yeah, I miss.I was at the end of our dinner at the end of the day and she said, "Oh, look, there's my family here. She's a big hugger. She's always been here. She's always been good to me. When we're married and we do the same thing, that's the thing. I'm so glad I was home with her."A couple of years ago she said she got married.""Oh right. A couple of years ago she said, well, my husband didn't want to have kids. So I said, well I'm going to give him a little money. Let's just go to school next week so maybe we won't have to look for work."When I asked what the word "Money" Means, she said, "It's money for us, money for our kids, money for our future, whatever it is, just you kno...
385|We were on our way to a job and someone started to say that 'you don't have to run to get a job', so we got off the subway. I had seen some guys in a bar and I saw a couple of guys. All the guys were getting out of their cars and I started taking pictures. I went to ask my supervisor what the hell he doing there because he had come back and said he was doing the job for the last few days. I said 'oh, I should have done that earlier! I'm sorry, I don't want to be like the guy. This has nothing to do with me!' And they said yeah, just you know. In a short time, I got a nice job where the company would put us in a job-hunting business and let us go through the process with the supervisors. We had some good jobs. In fact, I was really happy.Now, as a former manager and manager of the company, you're a full-time employee and you're an extremely experienced and good one. Do you know, "How many years ago the bosses could have been better off?" What about today?I think one of the things that you get that comes onto the screen, which I want to talk about, but I don't know if there's any real time frame for what can you say—if you look at history, there are many things that go along with that. And as a former manage...
386|My wife just saw her daughter walking out of the house and said, 'well, I'm in a coma.' And the next thing you know, I'm in the hospital, I'm in cardiac arrest, and I'm not in bed. My daughter was like, 'no, no, no,' and I said, 'oh my god, there's someone there. Can I tell you how I fell asleep?' She came in and said, 'i didn't even know I can't sleep,' and the next thing you know, she's in cardiac arrest, and she's just like, 'i can't take my daughter to the hospital, because she's in a coma.' And I said, 'well, wait. You'll understand.' So she got so concerned about me and said, 'i got to the hospital because I know I can't take my daughter to the hospital.' And she said, 'that's your right, so that's how I said, so you can take my daughter to the hospital.' And I said, 'yeah.'And then you know, we are in a place where we have a hospital at which I can't take my daughter to the hospital. And I'm like, 'oh my god, there's someone there and I'm in cardiac arrest. Can I help?' And she said, 'oh my god, there's someone there in the hospital who's dying,' and you know, I'm like, 'how can ...
387|the two were very close because they were just two really good friends and I had just met them twice at my college and they were on our way to college and it took us a few days but it seemed like there was a pretty good chance that they would get together and I went up to go get a drink and they just said, "You can go with me." And I said I don't even know what I thought of it and they said, "Oh yeah, you can go with us or you can go with them" And it was really hard for me to not let them go and it was real hard. It was like, okay, I'm going to go with you like that, but now I gotta do something because I want to do something with my life and then I kind of feel like like, "I don't know what that is going to be like" And I'm like, "Uh-uh, I'm not going to talk to you, that's not right."I wanted a few drinks. I wanted some of these small things. Sometimes I'lljust go home and drink all day and go home and never get a drink and it's like, "Ooh, this looks like a pretty good shot, we do have a little run, I guess that's a good shot." But when you don't have anything like that, and you do have a lot of stuff, it's hard enough to sit around and do. Ther...
388|My husband came over here yesterday and we had a little talk about a game we were playing called the dead man's spline. It's played in every city we're in but my husband was standing there looking at some giant squid and he said, 'this is what it looks like.' It's a really great story and that's cool. At our next party, we were playing call of duty and we're playing star wars and we're thinking about this game. They said to me, 'if you want to be a fan of this series, this is the best game to play with it.' So we said well why play that game and how do we play in this weird setting? It's kind of weird but I wanted to give it a shot and say, 'you know how I feel about star wars?' Because we've always been friends.What about star wars: a new hope? Was it even your idea for the game?We've had a lot of fun with this game, but we've never had a concept concept for it before and we always think there are things that we should do. It's one of those things that is like, 'what can I do to give this a shot.' But at the same time we always try to bring it back to the point we are at now when it really felt like we made this game and maybe it's fun to think about it and to try to show you a more cool look....
389|One of the things i've learned from my experiences with other people is to never let the things in your life get the better of you.When I read a book you're working on where people write down your thoughts and feelings in your mind, it's no surprise that they want to tell you the most powerful thoughts and feelings in the world.You see, when you do this, you can't have the most powerful thoughts in the world.When you are working on your next book, you will not be able to tell people about it or make people give you the word "Fear."You won't ever be able to tell people what they don't want to know.What you can tell them is how you feel about your life.It's just that you can't let things get in the way of you working and living your life.We want to empower others by seeing them with different kinds of eyes.But it won't happen.Your work should never be restricted to trying to change your life.Now you realize that you are a creative person.You are a creative person.You don't need to be told what you should or should not do.You just need to be able to see those boundaries you've set in your mind.This is what I mean when I say we don't have to think about whether or not we should o...

He doesn't choose it, but he tries to make it his own.You're in love…you're in love.Don't you just love it?He's in love with you.Are you the most handsome man in the world?He has been.You're being really beautiful all the way up to the point where you have more of an ability to communicate your feelings in front of people than you've ever had before.So…he's in love with you like a good, good boy.Can you say more about how you're so passionate about this book?I love it!Is this the beginning of the end?No, but it doesn't stop. It's just a much nicer experience.What's your biggest regret?I've had two children before. I'm so happy, and I don't want to stop. I don't want to take anything away from my partner…why is this different for you?I love you. I'm the best friend I'm ever going to ever have...

392|one day in 2010, I had gone into a car wash, which I found on the street and drove over to the bathroom. There was a woman standing there. It had a big, old, white woman who looked just like this woman: a kind-of-bitter girl, a sort for whom men were always watching her, a kind of self-absorbed girl. I was looking up and down the street and suddenly I noticed this black woman, which was looking down at me in the bathroom mirror. She was talking to a black man in a black shirt, looking at me in the bathroom mirror, and she started crying. She said, "Hey, mommy, there's a black man in this car wash, and he's a little drunk." I didn't know how she got out of yelling because I was too frightened, and I was very concerned about her. It was a big misunderstanding, because she was black. I thought, "There's nothing in the world they can do for me. Just go back and get your hands off me." Well, this young white girl and I called my parents and they offered me the chance to see them.And we saw them, and it became my dream to get a job—my first job. And my husband and I worked there. I went to college, and I went to public service. We did four years for public service for new york. And I worked in private company—the ne...
393|It's not my fault. I was doing it for an old man. He's no longer my son. He never is my son… and that's what happened because now he's lost his mind and his conscience and all of his things he did was wrong. He was wrong because he did it to my son, he got him out of jail. I gave him a hard time. I got him out of jail for the whole damn war… I gave him a hard time because he was a criminal, he was a traitor. It wasn't his fault. But he did it because he was willing to pay for it when he felt like it. So why didn't I let him suffer like his son?But, I'm not going to talk about this for a long while. I've been talking about this story, i've been seeing this story, and I'm glad to have you here. I wish I could talk about my son because I don't have time to talk about this story because I'm going to put that out there for a while. And so, I want to tell you how I came to realize my son was not my son. My son did not get out of jail like I had hoped. He was allowed out. He was allowed to go to schools. There was no place for him. This was a small town, a little suburb, but it was for sure a place.He could walk. He could cook. He could g...
394|This past sunday morning my wife asked when I was expecting my second child. She asked to have a quick shower so we could have a drink. We had a little bit of a run when we got home and we were asked if I had a child. She said we were staying and I told her we are staying for about 5 minutes. She asked why I was giving her the name and I told her this was because she needs a baby. She said we need a little while longer. She gave me a little while to prepare her baby and she walked out. I came out to tell my husband and the kids that I am expecting my second baby. It was so much better and I had a lot of excitement about it. I am very thankful to my wife for bringing all the joy out of this experience.Pamelawe're so grateful for this great baby. I can't thank her enough for saving me so much trouble and this incredible baby. We love you and I'm so sorry to see the world ending for you.Jenniferas a happy little girl, I wanted to tell you your news. Just when I was going through a baby blues and just after my second child I was crying. I had to tell my sister about it so she would not have to do it while I was there. When we opened our eyes and she looked over and said I had only a few hours to live I thought it was going to be okay and the...
395|One time when we were on the plane, when we were in new york in the middle of a trip, it was very early in the morning, and my wife was leaving for her day off. The first time I saw her was in the bathroom after we had got off the plane and I heard her scream. I thought she was going to go away and then we heard her in the kitchen. She was crying for 10 minutes. I kept listening to her for six hours because she was talking to us all the time. I never heard her speak. She said she was just doing the job for the guys and her boss would come. She couldn't leave.They walked across the room. I was standing next to her and she just stared at me for a minute. I said, "Don't worry. That's all you need to know." I didn't have to say anything. It was such a bizarre day, not because she was crying. It just was so hard to focus because we were being yelled at by her friends, so we were screaming. And there was a woman in the kitchen who had just gone up, and she was still crying.I thought, oh, what is she doing out here, what is she doing out here? And she was screaming so heavily, and I was so ashamed. And after I was able to calm her down about it, she told me she couldn't be with my daughter for four years because of the abuse sh...
396|I was a student at a school at the time I was studying medicine. I was a middle school teacher, and I saw this strange blue-eyed girl with a green face and green eyes on the far side of the room. She was wearing a green suit. I noticed in the black of her hair there were two white legs and blue eyes, and I was like, "Is that you? What's her name?" She's white. She looks like she's about to fight." "Uh, yeah, but there's none of that. I'm not a fighter. Not at all. If you want it to clear up, you're gonna have to fight. I can see why you would want to go to a school that's just a small corner from where I grew up, but it just seems like it would be a bad idea to go to anything you don't want to, or anything you don't want to. That's why they give a lot of money to the school. That's why it's so dangerous for the kid. It's just so ridiculous. It's a very high school, a small corner from where I grew up." The girl was a school teacher. She was my teacher, and even she didn't know how special it was for a kid of her age to be on the school's top. Now her teacher is a student, and she was also my teacher. You see, I was taking two class-week grades, one of which wa...
397|i was very fortunate to find a friend of mine, who was an international student at new jersey state university. I had just enrolled in a year of high school when my friend went to work on a project. He had just completed the course on the subject of "New jersey state, the most creative state of the world".My mentor and I had a few drinks and later I got to talking about my work. He told me that the best way to describe it was that he was talking about "New jersey state, the most creative state of the world". I remember telling my mentor what I had seen at the institute and what he said.He was talking about the very first time that I went to nyc to study at nyu. It was in 1990 but I was a freshman in the class of 1998. I was sitting next to a group of young scholars studying the subject of the new jersey state.So I saw them go on an interesting trip to manhattan and my mentor's house.My mentor and I were there and they did what I had done before in new jersey. They invited us there as well.We set up a meeting at new york state university and I was there in early 2003. The meeting was just about to start.The students were looking at the book, "New jersey, a new york times newspaper" Which was at the time a newspaper in the old downtown section of the university...
398|As a child my father died from an encephalitis in a car accident in france. I was in a hospital one year for an accident, only to be diagnosed with an encephalitis from a car accident and have to drive home four times in a row and suffer from it for years. That meant that most of the time I got to see my father again. His name was richard. We also had a baby and his name was john. Then, in the late '80s with the passing of my dad we began being told of this new disorder called deformed encephalitis from a car accident but that didn't work. Our doctor told us that if you lose a child, you lose it. We were told that when the kids were born it wasn't possible to lose a child with this condition, but our doctor told us that it must not have been possible.We came here five months ago to have dinner with our granddad. He said that he had seen two of his two daughters with this condition. He said that he said he went through that process when he was about 11. I said no, I didn't think he should have done that. So, three months later I went to the hospital with him to tell him that I had not seen his daughter, that he was not allowed to see my daughter, that my baby was very young, and that he had put his name to my baby after all. I went home and called my grandmother, sh...
399|A friend of mine was very much involved in the local sports community in los angeles and had this relationship. A friend of mine was working on a basketball team. And he had his girlfriend working there that year. And she was working there for a long time before he left. He was a really good basketball player and he wanted her to be a big part of that team.And her relationship with the coach started to develop with his dad and his wife. And that relationship became extremely personal and it began to spread to other kids, too. And those kids were pretty good to be around with, especially in the weight room because his dad had been a big fan of his.So I started talking to other kids. I told them about the coaches -- the kids were very close friends. But they didn't know exactly what to make of it.The first day I spoke to each kid, I told them that I wanted them to know that their dad was probably a great coach. I wanted them to think about what it means to be a really good coach. They were very confused as to why I would want that, that's all. I told them what it means to be a great coach and what it means to have a lot of fun.And they were very supportive. And they didn't just want it to be a secret. They wanted me to come to them as they grew up and tell them what it means to be a great coach...
400|My dad gave me a gift when I was 4, that was the first birthday gift I ever got. This was before my mom got ill, and I had to get up and do a lot of homework, and my mom was like, "I got this one." So, my dad got me that one when we were two years old. He gave me that one.I grew up to be a very athletic kid, but that year was a pretty big one, and I ended up winning four games for the ducks. It ended up being a long season for both of me, but all of that came from good coaching and a very important year for both of us.I just had to grow up in a city that was very supportive for me. So far, I'm really proud of what both of us accomplished together. And I'm grateful for that.What is the season like for all of you?It's been quite tough. My schedule with the ducks is very similar to mine. I've been on a lot of different teams and things had to change that have a lot to do with college football, so i've probably had a bit of time to reflect on and find my way back into it.I think about this stuff very often as my dad and my mom went through it. As you know, being seniors, my mom was very worried when she put me on their team that I was going to be a freshman and the...
401|i was living in my house in new york.We were at my neighbor's house, and he was sitting on his porch, and a young man and a woman were lying on the ground with a shovel stuck in the ground.And then suddenly I heard a noise.I was not the only one.I was standing near him when he saw me. He pulled the stick out of the ground, and said, "You saw me."And he said, "Then I thought you were a baby."And I started crying because my father had seen me cry.At that time, my mother lived here.So she called the police. And when they got there, they saw me.They saw my shirt, and they said, "You should tell somebody if you can see you because you're white."I came down here and said, "I'm white."Then they saw this.They said, "You must tell someone if you can see you because you're white."And I said, "I'm white."They took out my wallet, and I kept making notes, and I kept going up and down.I was in the process of running around thinking that I was going to be a better mother than I was.Then, I saw this white man standing there.Then they saw me...
402|I'm a journalist working for a local news organization, and the story of a man who wanted to die of a heart attack. He had just been shot and killed by the cops a couple weeks back. His heart stopped the same way it always had. He was a normal kid at the time. He would just go into a bar and just walk out in the street, and no one would notice him. He would just just be running around, not really taking any notice of what was going on, only just going out and stealing from people. He was just a normal kid. It felt like a day after that, and he'd lost the ability to be the one that he was.In my own life my life has been a long series of stories of loss and grief. My parents were very poor people and I was always trying to feed their families, even though I couldn't support those families for the rest of my life. But at the same time I was getting a job and then I started working for a big financial company.Back then you had to pay a huge amount of money for the coverage. You'd get an advance to do interviews, make some cover up, get some of your own money and then it was taken out of your paycheck—and from there I went through everything. It's not like I'm doing that anymore. Now I pay more money. I'm paying for my own health care, for everything for my family, for my ow...
403|It would be interesting to know which way the story came together.Juan gonzález: we're talking about the movie called the godfather. The movie that we're talking about, which is called the godfather. It's a little bit about a very different kind of a person. He does get into a lot of things with other people. He gets into many different things with his family, with his wife, and with family. And there are a lot of things that he's done that were a bit of a surprise to me. It was hard to get out of the room. He's pretty much in a relationship with all his family. I've known people who were in a relationship for years. It's strange.Michael richardson: yeah, but that's like a lot of the stuff that we've done on this whole thing. The fact that you make all the films that we make on this film -- that's an interesting thing because the films we make are all about this -- the idea that it's a good thing for people to have children. We don't want to say we don't. It's just the fact that there wasn't enough money to make all this money. So the movie is about this idea that, as a parent, you're like, "What is going on here?" You're like, "We have enough money! Where are we gonna go next? How do we mak...
404|Our parents were not even living in the house. At first we were worried they might run away, but the house was really in our backyard. We thought they might try to destroy it, but when they went back, they said, "We're going to put it away. We don't care where you live, we care where you live." Then our parents said, "This is a waste of time. Let's leave this place." They put it in the backyard. They turned the lights off and the lights on. It takes a lot of people to be able to get out of your house and see the sun going up and down.They've tried to get rid of a lot of things. And they're telling me it's a waste of time to go get a toothbrush, which is not a good idea, because it's one of the reasons that you don't have toothbrushes, because in most of the world toothbrushes are toothpaste. You can't tell a dentist to take out your toothbrush. I've seen it. I've seen it with the toothbrush. I've seen it, really, it's a waste of time. They said, "You can't use a toothbrush, we won't give one to you." They said, "The reason you don't have it is because you're a stranger." So we got the toothbrush.Amy goodman: and the dentist in charge that said, "You ca...
405|I was a kid and a friend of my husband's called him up that week and he had a picture of a beautiful little girl playing with her doll. It was an adult's idea. I don't know if I would have ever gone that route, but we'd seen her on tv or seen her in movies and there were stories and even pictures that were about the same girl. So I said, "I'm really interested in getting that picture of her, what can we do to help her get that picture with her doll?" But ultimately, because we were kids, we were going to make that idea come into our lives.A: how do you make your child's life as interesting and meaningful as possible? And then, there's that other stuff where you do not want to make your child have that.A: I think that you can, I think it's a good idea, I think it's what I started. I think there are ways in that particular situation to allow your child to be really engaging with you. People are not going to like kids for how they are. How do you help them find their own happiness? How do you tell them to not be in the way? Do you think children should be taught to love their parents, especially children who are not their parents?A: there's no question that children have to feel like part of a community or at least a family. Kids must be very connected. They also have t...
406|I'm a student of a student body in a college. I was there for nine years with a student body, but I was never a student of that person – and now that I am, they take us for granted. I just want to tell a story, to see my classmates and my community growing.I am looking forward to doing my fair share of speaking engagements. This has been a challenge for me – I have to take on a challenge that I have not been able to. When you are learning about the importance of being a good student, it really is very hard to explain, and it will be challenging to say to someone, 'you have a right to be here but you have to go down this path and show it to them.'I've heard that many times recently. It has been to great lengths. The process of saying I want to speak to students is a really daunting one. I would say the hardest bit of all, and it's one that I think i've had the greatest experience of speaking at is when it came down to just saying, 'i hope you get to speak to me. I hope you get to talk to me, I hope you get to talk to me about this.' I just do that.The biggest thing that has been really difficult to say, and that really has been the hardest thing to talk about is what you've achieved. I have never had a better understanding of the students.I hav...
407|I don't know how to tell it. I don't know how to tell a story. And I was looking, for once, at what they were using and how I could do whatever they were telling me to do.Juan gonzález:this is the kind of story everybody's telling right now. This is the kind of story that is still happening because the mainstream media doesn't do it.(soundbite of tv show)greg pak:i don't know if it's true or not, but when it came to the clinton campaign, the clinton foundation and all these scandals, this whole thing has always seemed to be a very small part of the puzzle.John mccain:why is it that if we could change this, why doesn't the media do this?Juan gonzález:i think the main thing, as you say, is to change the narrative that the media and the political class doesn't like.Kathleen ellis:it's like how do you change the narrative if you don't change the narrative for your own sake?Juan gonzález:you look at the history of american politics. It's the history of all the revolutions in history. It's the history of the first world wa...
408|One of the things that really stuck out about bizarro was our obsession with the story of muppets. What I loved about this story that I found difficult to comprehend was how the characters would behave with the muppets that were coming their way. They would get stuck. It was kind of a double entendre. In a lot of ways my favorite character from this universe is the muppets. It was a character that was so completely different from the muppets and was so much more human. The main thing was how they would get stuck on, and I found that quite a bit easier to understand than what they would seem to do. I found that to be incredibly helpful in trying to capture the essence of the character as a human being in that story. I found that was something that was quite difficult to understand.A couple others I love about this series are the characters' personalities, their history with the muppets, and how they became our main characters. Muppets themselves are very different from the muppets as a group. The characters are sort of like a family, being part of a family with a specific identity. But they are also very different characters from the muppets as a species. They are kind of like an amalgam, with a lot different emotions and characteristics. The family is more complex, has more emotional baggage as a whole, and it is definitely not more humanistic or humanistic in many ways. Bu...
409|When you have a problem that is your own, you need to deal with it. You have to think about how to do it. It takes practice. That's why I want to tell you a story about my father. His problems didn't arise on his own. They are due to a family that wants to work hard. They also believe that if they work hard enough, they can be heroes. Their father's problems were his problems.My dad's problems were his problems. When my dad was a teenager, his mother took him to an orphanage. The school was called a orphanage. I was there and we were all given the same basic school system. For example, I was the only girl in the class. My mother would say, "I wish I were a boy." I used to tell her about how my mother taught me that I can be an amazing boy so she couldn't tell my father why he shouldn't be a boy. I'd get really angry and then a few days later my dad would get angry again and he'd put a pillow over his head with tears running down his face like, "I told you so." But my dad never said anything. He never told me that my father shouldn't be a boy. If it weren't for him getting angry at me, I don't think I'd be there today.And so he was the only boy in the class. You know, that's the kind of guy who woul...
410|I think this is a great story in terms of how we made this. I don't mean to be judgmental, but I think our first decision was going to be just look at our history on this. In 2012 we made the transition from one to the other. Obviously we don't talk about politics anymore; this country, we're still doing the same thing we always have; we never change the status quo of politics.We have that debate; it's in the back of our minds every day, when we've got a bunch of people who were elected and are running for office. They're not just candidates. They are leaders. They are people who are going to talk about what's going on in this country.So, that one moment was when we had all this talk and our policy, our campaign, our movement on issues on both sides, we were talking about this big picture that we wanted to create. And the fact that this country needed donald trump to lead us because our party is now the party of the democratic party? I don't think so.I think they want to take advantage of the fact that they're the party of the democratic party. When we started, we had an election. And it was a huge win in terms of people feeling very strongly that we would be a party of the people.To have the same level of optimism is amazing, and to have the same level of hope and excitement is going to b...
411|I got out of an old house in chicago and a friend told me, "A former high school coach wants my advice. He says he doesn't recommend that you go to a job where you have to win. But don't think of it as a job where you can win. Instead, you must go over to the best job you can get." For me, I went to the big jobs. I lost my whole family.I was able to go back to my family. I have three kids, but I haven't been able to go back to the family for four years. It's been crazy. I had people tell me we could not go to work, but that it's only because they can't. I don't want to go.The first time my husband had to deal with what he saw as a man who would make a poor life, he told me, "You have to be kind of self-reliant, so you can go back to home. That's the first time you know that you're never going to be able to do it."He's in jail now in illinois, so it was his problem. His wife was not being nice to him. He was saying, "But not this time," Which was an insult.But that was before he started dating. He has to go back to his family because he can't go back to his family.It's sad but you know, we hav...
412|I was a teenager, I was born in 1947 at one of the worst times in my life. I was 16 when I was kidnapped by a mob and forced to give birth. I was 14 on the day when I was attacked and attacked by a mob. I was 17. My mom asked me about it. "How do you deal with a mob that beats up girls?" And I said if I was a girl, I was a girl. She told me that if you had a girl, you don't have to go to the police and deal with it. She didn't even know about the whole issue. If you look at the reports it's not like a thing. In fact, I was in the police station, and I said "Okay, I'm going to go with you." It was an illegal operation. I was the most frightened and scared. On the way to the police station I was stopped by a young man for saying something in spanish and I just said something to him. I said, "What are you doing?" He said "I am being beaten up." So I said, "You mean my head is getting cut off for this?" It was quite shocking but at the time most people were not aware of what was happening. But they came to see what was going on, and they came to see what happened. And the situation was horrible and horrible. I never went to the police, where I had been a prosecutor, but I got arrested at th...
413|For a while there in the late 19th century, I worked on a project that was not a piece of programming or a piece of philosophy but a piece of philosophy of language. The idea was the concept of language and what language is, that we could think about our world, our way of writing and how we should think. We were starting from the very beginning, with the idea of thinking out our own truth, not from the belief system of a particular set of people, but what, what is happening in our world right now. I was working on a project of kind of trying to make the world a more beautiful and more beautiful to be in. I didn't know what that was going to look like, but the idea of thinking out our own truth was so powerful. I was trying to help us figure out a way to be in that world so we're not just stuck inside the box as a kid or having to hide that from others. I think I was the first person to get the idea of language, the idea of philosophy and what philosophy is. I think I was able to say that what you say is your own truth, not yours. I thought that was really the way that we thought. And then I realized my work was going deeper than that.Why are you doing this now?I don't know.How did you come to do this?You would write your own books, but you didn't want to do ...
414|I was a 20-year-old white female who was a student at uc berkeley. We went to a party for a girl. I got an email from a friend, who was very upset about how I was handling it, the student body at uc berkeley had been taking so much action against me over this. I had no idea what was going on, until I was getting an email from my friend. I was in a class that had some students from different backgrounds doing things. I was one of those students. I think my friend said she got angry, saying, "You're going to have to do something about me." I started talking to her, and she said in her first email to him, "No, we need to talk. You're going to be okay." And I said, "Well, that's not going to happen." He said, "Well, okay." So that's why I got so upset. I remember what happened and how upset this was because I felt like what all of the professors saw was wrong and wrong and wrong. They were teaching me so wrong. And I was told, "Well, you're going to be okay." And I said, "Well, we're going to move on, but let us just find a way to get through this." So the last thing that happened was I heard that in one of the student's emails, I sent my friend to let her know that I was doing something wrong. And I was lik...
415|A couple of years ago I was working for a company called kpmg in germany. They were selling software and services for a big company and they were giving away freebies for your good work. The software developers were actually giving free stuff to their customers which was really interesting. Now the software developers have taken that away because they were really happy and didn't think it was a fair play. They had just given away free software. So they started giving away free software to people and started giving them free stuff even though this was a very good service and they're actually very grateful that they've given away free stuff now. So they gave away free stuff, but now they're giving away free stuff to the people who are actually giving away free stuff. And this also doesn't get them involved in other aspects of their business in any way.It's just fascinating to me that for example, in this case it was a simple, straightforward business, where the business model was to give away free stuff and go on to build a website, but now we see that the business model is quite complicated because of the nature of the business model. It's the way that there's no incentive for users to give away free stuff. It's the way that there's no incentive for people to do whatever they want, especially when they come from an income background. So I don't think the same is true with the free stuff they gave away. My thinking is that what we want our customers t...
416|I am a retired teacher in a school who has been in the city for seven years and has spent time in san jose, oakland, and san diego. I attended a few conferences on the topic of urban education, and I found this event a way for me to share my ideas and research. It is an awesome event; at the end you will have a chance to share your ideas and my own research and expertise.So I was excited to be able to be part of this project. I have always tried to make this my main mission.I was going to leave on a rainy day, and my two students were tired. I came with me and I thought I would go to a bus stop, to the university of california at berkeley. The university of california at berkeley is a place you don't want to go. And when you ask for "Education", you get "Education" That is not for us. We need students.I took the bus on my way to berkeley. I don't remember which campus I went to, and what the cost was. So I took it in berkeley so I could learn some valuable new knowledge.This was not the first time I had been sent from my "Classroom", to my home for three days. For the first year, I had to leave. One of the guys asked me for my address. Now, I had to keep track of my students.When I was going to a semina...
417|You are coming out with the new album, you do you?Oh, yeah. My name is jason. I'm an ex-guitarist of the group. And i've been playing music for a couple of years.Tell us about that song. You played it on the band's upcoming album.Yeah, it was a song we didn't like, and it was the first time we'd done a song and said "Hey, we want to really make it a big band." And I said, "Listen we all have some issues that we don't want to play with. We don't want to do it with you." And we ended up talking to dave. He and I were like, "We're going to have to make something that's something everybody has been singing about for a while." And I wrote a song and played it and we did it.The album that you wrote, "I want you to know" Or "A little song," Was the one that gave birth to the "The new" Video for "The new" Album?Yeah, I wrote that.A new video for "The new"?Oh, I wrote it.Yeah.So you wrote it?Oh, I was like, yeah.You went to a big new york concert, and it was your house party.Yeah, but it was my house party...
418|In the early days for my first book, I talked about how I always had a plan. I knew I wanted to finish the book by the time I came back, to create a sequel for my children, or for me to write another book. That's the plan—i was always looking forward to getting on the first page.[laughs]what happened? It was always very close to my heart at first, when I got on a page. I always knew that if I got on the page—and this came from my very first book, it was probably one of the last few novels I'd ever published. My goal was always to try to write a new book, and I didn't have any goals other than that. I was always going to get up to a certain level of writing speed I needed to continue writing my book—that's when I would stop reading and say, "I really need to think about what I'm reading now," And that's when I started looking for other ideas.What can you tell us about what happened to your writing in those earlier years when you were making movies?[giggles] I remember being on the front cover of two different magazines, which I called "The magazine," And I went to the back. On the front cover of the magazine, I had a very clear vision of my world. On the back cover, it was a picture of a small, yellow-haired girl...
419|I am in a hotel room in a city with two million people, and I don't want to put anyone in there, let alone my daughters. So I had just recently come back to town to meet with a friend. He got a call that he needed money to pay for an elevator. He was making about $10. He got a little bit annoyed about this little guy with big glasses, but he just said, "Don't worry about money. You don't need to worry about this little guy to get a cab and get you back to the hotel." That's right. He said, "It's just a hotel room because it's the least expensive hotel room in town. We're gonna pay you a couple dollars to get home." And so, that was a big shock to me, because my daughter had said, "But that's like a taxi fare, and that's the way it's supposed to be." And so, that's when I wrote off all those things, and because of that, it's hard for me to say no to your money. It's hard for me to see how you got that money, because you didn't even pay for the elevator, and now, you're making $10 to $12 a week. It's pretty hard. It's going to take a lot of money to make a real car, right? I mean, my daughter's trying to buy a house in the big city, so I think that's the bigges...
420|It's not like I have anything to say about you?No, it's not like I mean you, at all.You have something to say about me too.Just like I don't have anything to say about you, I don't have any to say about you.Your family was not important to you.They weren't important to me.You have no family.They weren't important to me.The time I spent at home that I spent working as a nurse and babysitter is still hard to describe.It still feels like i've missed you, you are the star of our show, you are the star of your show.And sometimes I think that you are the only one who truly cares.I like to think that you're the one who truly cares.And you're the one who doesn't make me feel special.Well then, as if this wasn't bad enough, I know that this is not really true.I know that this is not really true for many people.I know that it's not really true for many people.It could be.It could happen.But I have no power to change what I think, I have no power to change what people think,i have no power to change what others think....
421|You saw my son on the street when he was 4 years old. He was lying on his stomach and he said, 'you've taken my son." I turned around to see my mom, who was smiling and didn't look at me, and she shook her head. I looked at my son and she said, "I didn't mean anything to you, I just wanted to do something for him." And she said, "I want to make sure you know what I did for your son." So I did it. I'm not an attorney. I have a case law license in new york, and I'm the only one who's represented these boys that are brought to trial as adults." So we did the case, and he's a jury trial. So I have the case, but I'm in new york.Jackson: well, he got a $10,000 verdict. And as you mentioned he will be tried in the new york state supreme court for an adult. So I think this case is about fairness and I'm really excited to get out there and speak to you all.Maddow: you've done something very interesting for them, too, by doing an interview with the new york times that's very similar to what you did before. And that's about a third of the way through and you're talking about this very young man who lost his mother. He's 6 years old and he was diagnosed with leukemia, and h...
422|There were many good men and women who were so successful and so successful that they were able to work very hard and that was the story of america.The story of america was really about the people who would do all the work and help others get where they wanted to go, and the people who were so able to do all the work that they could. And it didn't get any more complicated. When I became president of the united states of america, a lot of people were getting into all kinds of things but that wasn't true of the real world.For that reason, I didn't like the way that hillary clinton treated america.Megah: why?Trump: because she was a very bad president. Because she was really, really bad at doing what she did. She wanted great wall street. She wanted terrible wall street. We lost so many jobs and she didn't do enough to fix them. So it got a lot worse. It got worse.Megah: so that was a bad situation?Trump: she didn't do enough. She did far too much. She was very, very bad.Megah: and so we lost because she really wasn't doing enough?Trump: no.Megah: you weren't really getting out?Trump: no. I didn't even talk about it when I did, I didn't even talk about i...
423|And when you hear it, you get that very thing. It's something you'd not hear in your life if it was your own story. It's about those who are in denial, those who need to understand. It's not about us being lied to or being told something that's not true. It's about being lied to. The best thing in the world is that the people who are being lied to can never really be truly honest. The other person who's not honest will always be like, "Well it's not true?" No, it may be, but it's not true, you don't know. And you're like: "Well I'm really sure that's true....
424|In the late 1970s, two men with a great deal of wealth entered the soviet union. One was a member of the politburo of the ussr and another a member of the politburo of the united states. All had to do was ask permission from the united states to go to the united states embassy in moscow, visit the soviet embassies in moscow, or write a letter asking for permission to travel to the united states. One of those who did so was an american who came to the united states in 1967 with his wife and their children. He became their interpreter and translator. It didn't cost too much, but he did have to pay taxes on the dollars he took from them for the trip. The other, who had a good paying job with the united states embassy in moscow, was given a permit to go to the united states embassy in moscow on the spot, because they had the same status. The visa had to go through an american immigration officer, who would ask him if he wanted to stay in the united states, to say yes. We had our translator. We had our interpreter with us.In 1976, the united states government began to investigate the illegal emigration of soviet immigrants to the united states. President reagan appointed a special investigator, who examined all possible ways in which the emigration of soviet immigrants to the united states was allowed. He concluded that the emigrants were to be treated as non-citizens. The special investigator would have to examine all case...
425|i was in my kitchen, a small farm, in a small village.I remember going to the door, and then looking in the open window, and there I was.It was the night before, the start of summer.I was very tired.I remember thinking about how I would like to go home, how I would love to go to this house, and how I would miss it.I thought, 'oh, this house, this house.It would be cool to go to this house.And then, I went to bed.I did nothing.I was still very tired.But then I woke up.When I woke up, I was still alive.My hair was still on my head.And my eyes were still open.My ears were still open.I couldn't stop thinking about this house.I had to wake up and look to heaven.What did I do?I said, "You look so perfect, dad. I want to live like this forever. I want people to think I'm all mine. I want to be my own people. I want to be happy that they won't have to live like this forever."And they told me to get up and go back to bed.I tried to find words, but it was only ...
426|I was going to let you know about this. I was going to tell you about this. I was going to tell you about this..Bill moyers: when I did that interview in 1989 that was when my father came out. It was so different. I didn't have parents to look after my child. I was doing it for my own personal pleasure. My son died in 1982. I left him alone with my grandmother, who was still in love with him during the time when I was there. When he was 8 years old he'd been watching me play. He'd been playing the piano, and I'd been watching his favorite tv shows. And I was watching them and I was playing with him.Bill moyers: and you were having children at home?Gary nolaney: yes.Bill moyers: and you came to the house after eight years?Gary nolaney: yes.Bill moyers: after that, when you went from being a mom to a dad, you really did have a change of heart.Gary nolaney: I have never been more surprised or disappointed. So I never will be. I think there was a time of absolute joy.Bill moyers: and I just thought it was fun?Gary nolaney: absolutely. And I wanted to go out there and d...
427|it started around 10 o'clock on june 14, 1978, when I was the senior editor of the associated press. It was my first assignment, the year newsweek won the pulitzer in its field.I had been waiting for news when the pulitzer, the award for journalism, came out. And then, out of nowhere, I was informed there were six other awards that had been awarded in the same year, and that their first recipients were two men from a young family from the suburbs of chicago, one of whom was a former chicago police officer named thomas "Duke" Mcveigh.It was, in other words, a huge surprise when a pulitzer prize winner came out of nowhere to announce that he had won the pulitzer.Duke was a man who had been on the front lines of a terrible war. One of the things that made him unusual in that he had been the first journalist to write an award for a war, not a peace, that wasn't a good thing. There were many good fellows who were in those jobs, and duke was a man who had been the leader of one of those.The problem for duke was not his lack of faith in the press.When I first began reporting on the wars, he would always have told me, "I was a war correspondent for the new york times. I wrote a book about the vietnam war." So it was very hard for me: we were the firs...
428|you're living in a suburb of dallas. This is a suburb that has seen a lot of immigrants. You're in your late twenties – you're working for google, not an apple, not a computer, but your parents came to america from hungary. You're working for google. I have a lot of questions. Can I say a lot of things about you?You're working for google. What am I going to do if I don't think in five years, and I want to be here, or I want to be here, that I know you're going to have a great life?You're working for google. What are you going to do if you don't think in five years, and you want to be here and I'm going to have a beautiful life?I want my child to grow up with you. They didn't come to america and they did. I don't really want them to know my child has become american. And here you have a child who is not american, and you don't know you're going to be here. I mean, it's wonderful. I've never seen you have this much talent. You look like a good writer. What do you think of my writing?You look like a good writer. What do you think of my writing?You look like a good writer. What do you think of my writing?I don't know if you have any question...
429|in the middle of the early 2000s, an oil spill in florida turned into a major international economic disaster, and there is no way to predict how the disaster will spill across the u.S.The next decade or so will be the first of many, if not the most, disasters with massive effects on the economy and the lives of untold numbers of workers.The biggest effects are in the energy sector, where there will be thousands of jobs lost every year. The energy industry is a $12 trillion industry — and the jobs in it will be wiped out by what is known as the clean power plan — which is what will result.The clean power plan is the most important environmental program in u.S. History, and the second of its kind. It set a dangerous temperature cap, put the nation's power grids on alert, and made it possible for thousands of fossil fuel companies to burn off their dirty energy.Today's disasters will be catastrophic for the country, the world, and the planet.It is impossible to know all the facts about the situation until you have been informed by experts, lawyers, the press, and even the best scientists within the oil and gas industry.I would not presume to be able to predict what will happen from the air at a national level.My best guess is that the next big disaster will be a spill from a natural gas well that could cause a massive leak out int...

431|I remember it very vividly. It's my uncle, david c. C. Wright. He was president of the national association of secretaries of state, and he was a great, great secretary of state. He was a good friend and a good colleague. He was very much a member of the republican party, and he came into the state department as a democrat and voted for eisenhower. Now, when I went into the state department, I did vote for eisenhower and the republican party. And in that sense, I was a member of the democrats. So what do you think happened?You know, the republican party of the day, they were very supportive. And I thought, what would a democratic president do? And I don't know if eisenhower was ever the person who would have supported him or not, but he liked to get on the show like the rest of us. I think you have to go back to the 1950s, when you were sitting under the eisenhower administration, at the time, when the democratic party was in the white house, the party that was the best in america, that was the party that was the most powerful in the country. You were in the republican party, but you were in the party that was really powerful in the country, and you came up against a very different, very weak party than the republicans.You know, i've said on the radio. That's what I'd like to bring up. But for the first tim...
432|A couple of months back, it came to me that I did the original story for the last episode of season 2, "The game." I've been telling it for a month now, and I know, you know, they've done some pretty wonderful things, so, you know, it's kind of taken my breath away.And it's been a very good story so far.I don't know if there's any time. It's been good.But, what the hell is that about? So, this is our eighth season.We've been through a lot.That's right.I can't wait to tell you. And, for you to do it, we have to have a new ending for you. Is there anything I can say about that?Well, it's a lot. Yeah, some stuff goes on, it's an odd situation, a long road. It's a whole new series, you know? It's, it's all about a character and a story.And all it takes is one man's word.That's what's important, man.We've done a lot and we're gonna do something. It's been fun. And I think it's gonna be even more fun than we did in 2010, which is, it doesn't matter what happens, as long as it's on tv, which is, it doesn't matter ho...
433|My first love is to tell a story about what it means to live, what it means to be successful as a person.I love to tell a story about what it means to be the person who is doing it, who is doing it well. I love to tell a story about what it means to be someone with the courage to get there in the right place. We don't just walk on and on, but we work hard, and we have the courage to change if there's a moment when we need it.I always love to think of myself as a good person, with all the good things i've done in my career, all the good things I have helped others in the life of their youth.And that's the key: you always have to find the strength to be someone who has given up the way you've always been.One of my heroes, and I mean this in a non-stop way.I've been doing that for many, many years without ever ending up in a situation where, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't go to a hospital or give birth. I wasn't going to give them up or get rid of me. I was, like, going back to my family. So, in some ways, that's what I believe I have achieved since I started doing that.And the good thing for me is i've changed my life and changed the world about me...
434|A lot of people go to the movies. I tell them that if I get a good job, I want that job. Then I go home, I get my kids, stuff. And then when, you know, I'm at home working, I'm at home, I'm at home, my kids are living with me. You know, that's pretty much it. Not that I'm not involved.So I kind of put myself in a bind. I'm working, I'm home, I'm at home, and all my friends are at home watching tv, and I know a lot of them aren't.What was it like working with a man who thought he was "The man" Who took his life?I mean, I was a kid, I was born, I'm about 18, I'm a little older, i've never been in pain before. I think it's a bit of a stretch, because I have the ability to take that loss, and that's what i've been doing with my life.I think it's really just a shame because, you know, it's all about finding the right person to take the situation to. In some ways, it's less about finding the right person, to be able to say, "Oh my gosh, somebody is gonna care for me." It's less about finding the right person.I just like working with people who do that too. Yo...
435|Every week, I write the final draft of the original draft and a few minutes after that, I pass them to my wife, who is the editor of a good newspaper, and the editors, who I trust to keep the drafts very, very good, come all the way from england and then bring them to me and tell me the story of it myself. I just get the story and then it's done.I've had a couple of journalists there on vacation since then. But I always read the draft and think "Why on earth would I write that into this?"No, no.Because, you are not talking about a couple of pages of text. There is such a huge amount of stuff that goes on in the draft. You have to go back and read the whole thing.And then when you're done, you start to read the text, and then you write and that's it. It just takes time.All right. We have a story. I do not think we want to do an episode in a six-year period. I think it is one that will have to be done for the rest of this season. So as I'm writing out the draft and writing the next few paragraphs, you take my call, but if you have a suggestion for a story of your own, I would love it.So we've got a little bit of time.All right. So I'm going t...
436|the mother of three-year-old samuel has been living with her family for 15 days while in prison and she is unable to work because of the trauma. She cannot get the money to cover her expenses and is living at home alone with her family. When it comes to the school, they say, it is so small.But when we finally get help for samuel, it doesn't cost her.Her family were unable to pay rent and rent alone, so now they are spending three days a week outside and the family is being held in a halfway house.The police are also waiting for the help of the girl's aunt."The police believe she is a victim of the attack," Said katerina. "They just wanted it to be over. Samuel has never been able to pay rent, rent alone."So they are holding her in a "Super-tight" Cell.When they finally get help, they say, they are afraid.So they call her aunt and the police come to her house."They said they will call the police at one of the four hour times that people get in there, they can ask anybody who wants," Said katerina."They will come and ask, 'where's samuel?' They will say a few words like, 'mom, why don't you do your homework.' After that.""The...
437|The guy who said his name was tom. He was a very successful man. He sold a house in north houston and the rest of it he got to build a new house for himself and then started a company in houston called the coney island company. He put up a lot of money and a lot of people saw him and said, "Oh, cool business. He made the house into a nice thing. He's a great builder. He is an amazing salesman. He brought in a lot of people to houston," And he was the first to go to south texas."And he built the house in great harmony with his reputation."Well, we had a few people that had their houses, they didn't build houses. So what we did was we sold some of our houses, we bought some of our condos, and then we gave them to people. They lived there and they rented them out. And the next thing you know, they came in and they had to sell some of our houses and they had to pay $100 and maybe $500 more."So, one of the guys who got arrested for marijuana was a cop who said, "You know, the guys that were arrested for marijuana are the same guys who were doing the big busts the last couple of years in the late 1990's and late 2000's. And they were selling your house. They're just like, 'you're in a lot of trouble.' And they wer...
438|A couple of months ago, I lost my job. I came back to this country with a kid, and we had a great time here. I learned a few things, and I learned a lot. But I didn't know what was going to happen. This is not the time to let the kid grow up. This is not the time to take on a job. This is not the time to leave. This is not the time to leave our schools. This is not the time to do the things that we want to do in our community, because as I was growing up, I went and left that school. So this isn't the time to say, "We will fight for you all to learn what's right. We will fight for your rights, you will learn what's right, when you want to learn." I went out and did things that I thought were right, because I saw a big difference between the right way and the left way. I knew where I was going to go. I knew I would be able to say what I wanted to say. And i've spent a big time talking with my parents and i've talked to them about this. I've been there. I've been there. And i've been talking to this president of course, and the fact that I spoke to my kids and heard their reactions is my experience.Q: what you would say to that question is, "You were a little crazy, you know?" And ...
439|I have come up against this many arguments on how to treat me. One of them is that I am too young to be a fighter, and that I don't understand what fighting is actually about, and that I'm too scared to be at all.My father has been the only fighter i've fought. He came from a catholic family who was catholic in all matters and was a warrior and he came from a jewish family who was a warrior and he came from a spanish family who was a warrior and so on and so forth.And so on, and I don't know why he's still fighting, but he did fight, which I think he's been doing because he's been so proud to be a professional fighter.And for a long time, I felt like there was a problem in my childhood. I saw that my parents were not right for a lot of different reasons. They couldn't see the meaning in the fight, because they didn't see the value of the fight as they actually had. So I could see that I was becoming more and more insecure about my self-worth and so on, which was kind of the problem.But then I was doing, like I said, boxing a lot – as much as I did for a time, but still I kept fighting. And I fought the best. I was doing very well, and that changed as time went by.So I was not as successful as I had alway...

Many others have also lost their loved ones."I can't even imagine what we felt."The only way I could explain it to my sister was telling her to go back home."I'm sure she had a lot of money but she didn't.

441|It took eight years to get here. You know, a lot, but it was fun. It was an adventure. Like, you know, if you were to read and come back and say, that I'm just so tired.But now that i've got that, I'm like, I don't know, I know, I'm having fun. I feel like I'm doing something. I feel like I'm making a difference right now.And you know, my mom and I all have stories, we all have stories. It's always nice to know what's going on. So, there's a lot to say, and then I read your book.(begin videotape)jonathan lee (voice of t.J.: "The man who lived": "No good dead")this is an amazing movie.And you did it so well, how do you feel about the reviews we've read about it?Jennifer canton: good question.I think there's really an opportunity to do this because it's hard to put the blame on critics and people who say, "Oh, it's good. No, it's bad. It's not good. You're gonna make it, we'll just go ahead and make it better. You can do that, we can make it better, so we just don't know what to think....
442|My parents were always very interested in kids, and I was always interested in people. But before coming out, I didn't have a lot. So I had to start thinking about how to build a life. I was an athlete, and that started coming around to me.What did you learn as a teenager about sports and life?I learned from my father at school, and that was it. It was fun. And it kept going. It was kind of a big step and a big accomplishment. It was a big accomplishment when my dad got to see his team play their first game, and then he got to see their team play their second game and see the way that they played. And it's just been my life since that.You're currently the youngest player in a top 20 college, with 3,000 career points (behind ucla's demarcus cousins). What would you say is the most difficult part of college basketball?There are two things that you have to deal with. I've always had this frustration about coaches. They've always wanted me to be a baller. And they've always been trying to make sure that I'm athletic. I had one bad game, and I was always kind of just playing the ball. They wanted me to be an nba player. I wasn't a scorer, and I wasn't that. I'm a defensive rebounder — I'm not an offensive rebounder. I'm a shooter. S...
443|One of the things that happened to me that night was that I was so much more interested in going back in time then where I was, and doing what I wanted to do with my life. I was going through a different life. I was going through a different time, my relationships were getting strained, I was thinking about the future and it was too late to let it go now. I went on record saying I wanted to go back in time. I said nothing about the next three years, but my father, the father that came to my family, that was me, that was my father. And then the thing that happened to me was that I was going through a different life. You didn't really know when what happened next made sense for you.What do you think about the media's coverage of the trump administration? Do you wish he had resigned?Well, the president is going to fire a lot of people, and those people are going to be charged criminally if they don't resign. I wish he was serious, and I wish he would have given a better warning to people. I think we've already seen him do that. He's going to make a terrible mistake.The trump family is on fire and it hasn't worked out. Is there anything that the media needs to do to prevent this from happening again in the future?I think the media is just going to have to figure this out by themselves. If they think th...
444|I've been a bit depressed recently. I'm not sure how to say it. I don't want to talk about it any more. It's okay. I'm not the one who's struggling with suicidal thoughts. I'm not the one who wants to talk about it. But I want to, because I think it's good that I'm here. I want to be alone. I want to be free from the tyranny of others. I want to feel safe, free from the pressures of society. I do not want to be alone, let alone be alone, let alone be alone, let alone be. I just want you to know that there's pain there, there's worry there, there's pain that comes from being rejected by others. There's pain that comes from being told what to do. There's pain that comes from being called by a father, an uncle or a brother or a sister. There's pain that comes from being rejected by a sister. There's pain that comes from being rejected by a son. There's pain that comes from being rejected by an older sibling. There's pain that comes from being rejected by a friend. There's pain that comes from being rejected by a student. There's pain that comes from being rejected by a peer. There's pain that comes from being rejected by a sibling. There's pain that comes from being rejected by a husband. There's pain that comes from being rejected by a father. There's pain that comes fro...
445|When I was at home, my grandfather was working in the textile industry. We got a job as housekeepers. We had one job; and that was it — one that, like everyone else, I would be paid, and we would get some rest. When I was 17, I went down to chicago and I went, and I didn't have my lunch on the table. When I was 23, I went to california and went to school and got to work at a big bank. And then when I was 21, I went to new york to live in new york; I didn't have my breakfast on the table. I was in the hospital in may of '76. Now, when I got through it, I didn't have my lunch on the table. I had my lunch on the table. And then I got my pay back. I didn't have my lunch on the table. I didn't have my lunch, on that day. I didn't need to take my lunch off the table.Amy goodman: now, there were some very courageous people on the street right up there. When you came to chicago to work, these young men came up and said they would help get your back on the street. They had to do this; but I'm sure in your own life some young man would say, "You have got work to do, but you don't have to take your lunch off the floor." No, I don't think you can...
446|it started out a bit like this, and now I just keep saying, "You know, I'm going to let this go. I want to stop this and I hope you'll stop it."I think a lot of people think, just for me, it's hard to do what I'm doing, to be a musician. When I was growing up, we would play music to ourselves. I think the problem there was that I wasn't really good at it. People thought I was a rock star, they thought I was a big man, they thought I was an animal. I don't know how any of that made any sense. That's just how it felt. What I was trying to do was just be a musician and just play music.Now I'm a musician. In fact, I'm doing a bunch of stuff with my wife and kids. The kids are in elementary school. My wife is a senior teacher at the college. We are in the same class, so we are going to do the same thing. I actually do all of this, and sometimes when I'm not doing it, my kids'll be sitting there and they'll say, "Yeah, I know." But I am just playing, playing the music, so that's what I think.I am so good at it. I am just a little bit of a perfectionist, and I think that if I could be a little bit more like a perfectio...
447|so we were listening to some stuff. We were drinking."Hey buddy, you have some great wine." We were looking at wine. It was a lot."How is that?" I asked.The man looked at me with a wry smile."I'm just telling you, you're not supposed to be drinking these beers.""That's not true?" I told him."Why is that?" He asked incredulously. "They're really good beers. They're not that good or anything, not that special tasting.""Yeah I know. It's been brewing and tasting for so long.""We don't really drink beer!" I blurted out."Hey dude, what are you going to do with it?" He asked. I was too drunk to know."It's good. It's good to be here, it's a good drink. I don't drink a lot of beer in my life. I guess I should look into brewing and tasting after that.""You're all right buddy. I should talk to you guys about it later.""Oh i've got some good wine. I'll see you tomorrow. I will."He then left. At this point I was sitting on the couch and looked out of the window at the trees. I knew I was going to be at the end of ...
448|I was in my apartment when my dad walked in on her. I had a boyfriend. He was a big guy. He was a big guy. He was my little brother in college. We were drinking and he just walked in and called his mom and said "Mom, what a beautiful family you have. You got all these beautiful families, are you sure you want them back?" My mom said "Yes, you are sure." She took us to a local church and told us that my dad had been killed. But when he said that to my mom and i, in an instant, I knew that my dad was dead. I knew that my mother was dead.In my new movie, god's not dead, I played a man, an old man, a guy who got stabbed. I was playing a guy whose name it's call the midwife. He died, and he had been murdered, because he was a man who was a man, a man with a name it's called. I wanted to show that a guy could die with a name it's called. But I didn't want to do that. I had no idea. I thought that it's going to take a while. I felt like I had to take a risk and change my movie and my life.As you know, i've been involved in many movies. My brother's an actor, my brother's a musician, my son a painter, my son a dancer. I wa...
449|I was about to leave for work when a guy named jim came into the room and said, 'you know, it's a bad day. You're out of work. You might get a little work done. You're going to be on a long vacation.' So I started telling him things like 'hey, I'm gonna go take a picture. I need you to come look at it because I don't want to come down on my knees.'"After going through the motions of telling his story, jim was able to come up with the idea for an open letter that could actually get passed around, and eventually, send his first of two letters to gwen guthrie.Here's what it looked like when the letter arrived:"Dear general guthrie, I write to you to express my condolences to you and wish you a merry christmas in your life.Sincerely,merry christmas to you"Sincerely,merry christmas to the people of the pacific northwest"Sincerely,merry christmas to the families who died fighting the great war"I feel so very sorry for the people who are losing their lives today while fighting the great war.

451|I was living in the philippines from 1981-2005. That was the time of the communist regime there. It was an unenviable situation. There were so many people, such as me, and there were so many people. It was a very difficult situation. I was living in the same area as everybody else in the philippines, and I felt it was a challenge. I had to get my life together with the people. That was the worst experience."As a kid, my childhood was spent in the jungle. So we had lots of little things that were in the jungle. We went to the jungle, you know, the jungle is so far away from the place and it's so crowded that there are all kinds of people waiting.""The jungle. All of it.""The jungle. All of it. But people would come back and see all of these little things. I was very tired from my whole life being in the jungle. It was all very difficult for me.""The jungle. All of it. I was going to spend my life in the jungle every day. Everything was so hard that it was hard to sleep, to read, to make the sounds. I was pretty exhausted, pretty tired.""My mom, my dad, my brothers, my sisters, all of them — everything I could think of to do or say to them was going to be difficult enough to go back to my mom....
452|I've been living in this kind of world for a long time now. I was born in the first seven months of my life. My family knew exactly where I was at. I didn't believe that I was gay; I didn't want to believe that people would think I was gay. I didn't really think that was a big deal, but I couldn't help but think about it. All of a sudden I had something that I hadn't known all my life and I'd spent so much time thinking about, and I was living in the middle of a very hard reality.I came to know many people who really believed I was gay, and they were the ones who were the ones that were really, really upset and upset that I thought that I was gay. And they would cry. They said, "No, that is not true." No. It was not true—it wasn't a really true situation. I was raised as a woman, I was raised as a father, so when the news came out—in the late 1980s and early '90s—when the news came out I was angry, and I was angry that the media was doing the things that they were doing. And now that I am alive, and I'm not worried about what might happen with the media, I know there are going to be some repercussions, but I don't know what the ramifications really are for me.I'v...
453|A friend of mine recently made a deal. He sold his house in the suburbs and sold it to someone else. He made a deal with a couple of guys on the other side of town who are about to buy. He sold it, he sold it again. He sold the house again, and he sold, again, he sold, he sold. And he's been the happiest man in my life.Amy goodman: I wanted to turn to his story, "How to make your own house in your neighborhood." The house is now owned by a woman. It was her house. She lives with her four children. She's married. They have three kids, but she doesn't get much more than that.Alexandria tinawas: I think, in a sense, I'm just an ordinary person. And I have a great feeling, which comes with the fact that I'm going to say this. And the thing about homeownership, as you say, is that it's so rare you'd have an old couple living together and you'd have two or three kids.I was talking to a couple of other people about this. I was actually in washington, d.C., when I first started this site. One year or so ago, I was just—you know, I started it, when I was doing a couple of articles for the local newspaper. I had just turned down a deal from the bank, and a...
454|it began about 8 years ago with the release of star wars: episode iii revenge of the sith. Now you can take this and make your own movies, play video games and do a lot of stuff from the movie and take it with you wherever you are.You can find video games on gog.Com here and you can order video games for your vr headset here.So how did this start?The idea of vr arrived. It was the idea of being able to connect with people that you could not connect with offline. The idea of having this wonderful platform that you could just play with a friend or with friends that you can play with anywhere you want, and if you needed to play in vr for a few days you could play it but if you needed to play in the rest of the world the game would be just fine.We started putting in the vr headset. We put some headset into an old pc that came with a playstation controller. We had some idea that would be that really cool for vr.But the whole process of doing this started with a lot of hard work. We didn't start at $10. It's not like we were going to make a $80 game for this price. It took maybe a month to get it going.The first thing we did was to find some way to make the game play. We had a couple of really interesting ideas which we thought were very cool, w...

I was watching, but didn't know where I was, so I went to my apartment.I was in a room, and my brother was in the front. I started to talk to him. I said, "I want to do a comedy show here. Is there any one in greece?""No one.""I'm going to do a comedy show in greece, and this is my last show here."He's in a big hotel with his mother, and we've got a big party waiting for us. We have an old man who was going through chemotherapy, and he's doing very good. He's doing really well and I can say with certainty that his body heals and, when nothing else to do, he's going to be ok.I was just trying to be clear. I was saying to him, "You want to be the one to talk to in a movie about your life or your career? Then I'llshow you." So he said, "I would never want you to talk about it.

456|I went to college as a student in south florida, and I was the first black student in class. My dad had been black for five years, and I had a great relationship with him. He was so kind, and everything just started to work out."I didn't feel like I had the right to be in a classroom. I just kind of felt like I had to grow up to be black."I was a single parent, so I knew my school was going through a lot. I was struggling to find an apartment, having trouble finding my own life, so I found my next move."After a few months, I began to think about it — and it was a very difficult thing for me."My mind was racing, and I just wanted to get out.

But we've got good people - it's not all bad -- but it's one major problem, one major problem where there's a huge gap in the quality of life. That's what the united states is built around. And when you're looking at health care, the affordable care act, that's exactly what we're trying to do.Chuck todd:what are the barriers to getting the kind of health care we really need?Andrew keim:there are many different people, really. So far, our plan has been one of the most successful in the united states.Chuck todd:what are the obstacles to making sure that the united states gets the kind of health care we really need?Andrew keim:first of all, I think we need to see that the american people can find their own, better health care plan.

458|There was an important event in my life. It was at a conference that I attended, the first one of my life. I had an introduction to buddhism and the first person I ever met was dr. Chingyai. He was a young scholar of chinese buddhism from hong kong, who later became a researcher, at this conference, who introduced me to the other students of buddhism. He gave me a presentation that was very inspiring, which I was thrilled about. It was a great, really good thing that I got to attend that conference. I went over and interviewed other people at that conference. It happened to be when they were teaching and writing about this. For many years I lived in hong kong. By that time I had been teaching there for almost 20 years. I was teaching there for about two decades. I was teaching with the first buddhist teacher, chingyai in hong kong for 15 years. But I was actually not there at that time. Chingyai was a great scholar of chinese buddhism, of course I thought that's what the chinese people considered the chinese people to be. So when I met his students and other people from that conference, I was very impressed. I was very intrigued by how much they had learned about buddhism. That was when I went and talked to chingyai. He was extremely kind and very intelligent. So I said to him, "Look at this guy and how much he teaches, how many courses he has taught?...
459|last week my brother sat me down at a meeting of the north charleston church. He was in the process of announcing that the church's mission had been canceled as a result of the violence in charleston, wv. At that point you would think that he was joking. But I had just been sitting with my brother when the church's president, the rev. Jerry jenkins, opened the door to talk with me. He said, "Brother, we're told the church of north charleston was never going to be able to hold a funeral. But we have to go to the funeral with the rest of the church."The next day he got back to me and said, "Brother jenkins, we are going to the funeral with all our loved ones tonight. If we're not going to do any kind of prayer or any kind of service tonight, we're going to pray for those who are dead, and they don't know how to pray." Then we went to the church's chapel. I sat in the pews and it was just like every other prayer that we did. The minister at the church said, "Brother jenkins, there is still only one chapel. If we do this prayer, that prayer will do so much. It will change your life. If there is one chapel you go to, we will open it, and then we will let you pray."So I did that.And I was sitting there with my brother, and jerry jenkin...

He always wanted to be a writer.One of the guys, who is also my middle brother. I was just a freshman. He was trying his best to be a writer. As a sophomore, he came in and they were shooting the film, and he wrote, "I'm gonna start a book. I'm gonna write an entire novel. The next thing I know, he's in a big truck, he's driving down the road and he's shooting the trailer." He was just super excited.It was so cool. It was like I was looking at someone and saying "You know, I know that I'm going to love this!" He just went crazy with me. He asked me why I was doing this. So he said, "You mean you wanted to be a writer? So you got that experience in you? How was the experience of being a writer?" And I was like, yeah, I just wanted to be a writer. We started shooting together and it was the perfect meeting for us. I mean, he was like, "You know what, I can handle all that stuff, man? I get it. But he's got me in his head."So we started shooting, and he was like, "I love writing. Can I just d...
461|It happened on march 12.I was sitting talking with a man I was helping to get to that point. He said, well, he was the president and he was the vice president. They said, "You're the president, you're the vice president, you're the head of the team, you're the ceo." So I tried to explain, well, we're going to be different. We're going to have different managers who're going to be different, and they're going to be different from us. So, I was like, alright, you know, we're going to be different, and we're going to be different than the president. And he said, this is the new president. And I said, well, we're going to be different.And I was like, okay, we're going to be different. And I gave them that speech, and, and they said, you can have your own boss. So, they told me that we're going to be different. But, you know, that's the one thing that I never saw. I never saw it. I never saw it.So this president went to the white house and put a big desk on, and it was like, you know, a desk, you've got to use it. You've got to use it. And they told him, "We need to use it, we need to use it the same way that you use it...

And you came right into my office and said, "You know, it was very upsetting." A few minutes later, I walked out.And I was sitting there like they put on a white face masks. I felt the air, the skin. I felt the pain, and I felt the anger.I'm in my office right now. It's not very easy for me to sleep, for me to not be happy.On the other hand, I still think I may have been able to sleep when we got married. I still think I was able to sleep. I didn't wake up.Do you remember, on saturday, may 31, when you came up to me, thinking about the news that I was married?I was just sitting there, thinking about it, when something happened that evening in the office. I woke up at 3.30 in the morning and I was in bed. … I went out of the office, I sat right next to my wife. It was the morning of april 17. And I went out of the office, I sat in the chair and I was a little scared. Like I was, really scared, and I couldn't make out anything. So I think I went to the police...
463|in the late 1970s, a group of people with high-powered intelligence was looking for a young, highly educated, charismatic, and very clever young man to help them become a more successful organization. He was probably a student assistant-programmer or a scientist, but he was a young, highly intelligent young man. They had a deep interest in human affairs, human history, and political science.They had the idea that they could hire an intelligence scientist, find people with high-level knowledge on the world of physics, chemistry, biology, and math, and they might go through a series of experiments trying to improve their knowledge, and they would find out how to get them to get better knowledge. They'd also know how to put a new invention in the hands of a human being, so they could get the new idea to market.And all of this was happening, and then, over and over, they figured out that people with high expertise in this kind of field could be so successful, they'd have people with lots of skills, and they didn't have to take the trouble of looking for people with very high levels of intelligence.And they knew that they could succeed. They had success with a bunch of people who had very high level of experience; they were using those people to make a really good product, and they're doing really well selling to consumers.Then they got to the point where they were realizing, "Wait ...
464|I was a kid, and I had a crush on my high-school junior year. At that time, it became apparent that this was not going to be a high school graduation. That year, I got my first job at an amusement park at disney world. I was just starting out, and I was so excited about it. It was about two years before I was even able to go to school.When you graduated, it was an incredible transition. We all wanted to be professionals, and I felt really fortunate to walk into the workforce to do this. I knew that I would have to get to the point where I was looking for work, as I had always done, and I knew that this was a very attractive job.What kind of challenges were your first job facing?There was a lot of things that went on while I was there. I worked with a lot of big companies who had talent, but I was also working with little companies at the time. It was very challenging. My boss would say that there was one kid, and I would say that she was a bit over-active, but that my skillset was really good. The other kid was a little bit shy and didn't show it. I would say, "I just feel like there's going to be a problem there."The company I was working at wasn't so great. They were very focused on how to improve my performance. They would say their kid...
465|When I was in elementary school, my principal, one of my teachers, was having a difficult time and told me that if I would only take a few more minutes to read the book, my school students would be in a better place. My teacher, I assume, just didn't believe me.A couple weeks ago I heard news that the federal bureau of investigation would not take over the national security of the american police force. I was not allowed to read or speak on the matter. I had my freedom and my civil liberties suspended immediately. I was even asked to leave the national guard and moved out of town.I was told that the police force would not be going to a place like this. I was told I was just 'not going to believe anything you say.'I went to the fbi and was told that if I had lied about what I was doing and why I was being asked to leave the fbi or go to the united states. That was immediately followed by a complete and total blackout in my ability to walk off the fbi property. I was also told that every time I tried to walk off the fbi property I would face a criminal prosecution for violating the fourth amendment. I had never been caught doing that. All of this was absolutely and very true.I didn't know how I would be punished if I said my story about being in a car accident in the summer of 2014 was true.I was in the classroom at firs...
466|I am in a house with an elderly woman, an elderly woman who died of a stroke during the 1980s. She had a stroke because the police didn't know who she was. And when they did they found her dead. So she went back to the hospital. She went back to her apartment, went to the doctor that was in the hospital where she had been, went to the home that she had lived in before, to get the results of her surgery on her. And there's one story. In the hospital, there are two nurses who took the patient. They took her and gave her the blood. The doctor gave her the same blood. And he said, what are the tests you can do that will help you for this case? I said, "What are the tests?" The nurse said, "I have a blood test on my brain. And she's the one who told me that she had cancer and is going to give me blood on her brain. And she's going to give me blood like a blood test. And every time she gives the test the nurse says, "What are the results?" And this nurses thing that's coming from my brain just gives her a feeling of a cancer. But that's not a very good experience for her at all. Because the nurse said — and I could not read because I can't speak english — that she doesn't want to give that blood, because that's been going on for a certain amount of time. An...
467|When I was a child, I used to play a very fast piano at the very tender age of eight, which is the time when I began to play it. I would go from home to my office, to a certain restaurant and I would play a new violin on the piano that morning, and that's when it would start again. And then when I was 16, I made this long story when I was a boy, because at that time I was a kid. A boy who had to be told the story of his mother.The song "Lucky star" Is one of my all time favorite songs. It's one of the most popular songs i've ever composed. It's the second most popular song of all time, which is very important to me. When I was younger, I loved the song and used to sing it in my bedroom and when I was 17, I sang it. And the song, "Lucky star" Is just as important to me because it's the single most popular song of all time.Do you like the feeling of the song, when you hear it? Is it funny?I was always curious about the meaning of the song. I always knew that the sound of the song was so different from the sounds of music, and I loved that the song was so different from what the music actually sounded like. When I studied it at the age of eight, I was just fascinated by how different it was, ho...
468|It would be easy to go off the rails and call it 'em, but I am not going there. I have a little bit of love for the people in my life. I love them. I hate them, but I love them because they are who I am."We are, of course, living in the era of social media. Social media has given us great opportunities to write about us, to share the joys of being human as humans. The internet is such a beautiful, beautiful place—the worlds of the human family, the relationships around us, the interactions of people we love, and so much more. The internet is an amazing engine of discovery.But if social media—it is not, as many people are convinced by the media and the messages it can send, and also how it provides us with opportunities to be ourselves, as we have been told, and for what is so often not so often—was really a great option to find my own voice. The internet had a lot to give, and I hope that it has helped us come together and grow as a group.But at the end of the day, I am what I am. I am a human being. I am here to spread what I love. I have seen life change as it has changed, and in this case, because of the online community, it has also changed as I have evolved.I believe that as human beings, we can only liv...
469|When you play, you get the feel of a child fighting off an invading army. But it feels more like an actual battle. In some ways, it's a bit of a metaphor. It's about what a war for food tastes like.You mentioned that you have a big story in the video that you're working on that you'd like to talk about before the next update of assassin's creed. I just wanted to let you know:when I was younger, I was playing games with my sister. We've gone to a couple of movies together. We worked on this game. The first two games for us were this new game called the last guardian. Because we were playing games, we had a little bit of fun playing games together. She and I were playing games, and she was always doing these little things. So we ended up going to parties. We were doing some stuff with her. When we were at school, she was working in the library. They would come along and she would sit and play. That's how we would play, just the way she does things. But that's not how we play. We always have some sort of character-based gameplay. We tend to play with the same kind of character, which is the one we are. But we'll go and play with other characters if there's something wrong. We try to talk to people and say, "If you can get up and play a little more together, you hav...
470|i have been working as a bartender of nearly two years. I am not much of a dancer, but I do have some of the best pictures of a woman. For the past two weeks, I have been working in front of a live audience on a couple venues, performing in front of a roomful of professional dancers. I have been looking forward to this experience. If you want a good night out, get out of here and find a good spot. Maybe you won't find a bartender. Or maybe you won't.Do you enjoy being a dancer? What makes you want to come out of the shadows and put your talents on display? And what do you hope their performances will tell you...
471|We were standing in a field, a big field, and suddenly there came a black man with a black cape. He was carrying a sword and a stick. I looked and saw him and I said: 'hey man, how did you feel?' And he said he didn't feel comfortable and he took his sword from him, which is a great sign. Then I said: 'oh, man, I'm sorry, you couldn't hear from me?' And I said: 'well, you have one hand on the sword and the other hand on the stick.' And he said: 'well, that's fine and I'm fine.'And we came back to the field again and this time we asked one of the girls for his name and he asked, 'don't you have a white cape?' I told him no. And she said: 'do I have a white cape?' That's when I said: 'i don't have a white cape.'And we told him: 'well, if you are not white, you won't be able to read anything. If you are going to do something, you can do it. That's what I'm like, so I will do it.' And he said, 'well, what about the other girls?' And I said: 'well, you are the only one who can read.' And he said: 'you are not one of the girls. I am white.' That's when I said: ...
472|We talked about two years ago. I was working in a bookstore in the town of la cordonne. We were talking about a book we were doing on a different topic, in the midst of another business called the future of money, and I was thinking about buying a piece of paper about money at a different price than it was supposed to be. I thought at that price there'd be no way it was going to sell.And that was very exciting. But then we had a second meeting with my boss and he said, well, we're not really sure why I'm buying a book—because it's just such a complicated topic, and I just want to give it a shot. And at that same moment we were talking about the book in front of my office, and I was thinking, 'you know, this book is so complicated. The world has changed.' And I said, no, it's very interesting to me. It reminds me of a book at a different price: it's really an interesting story.Juan gonzález: the book we're talking about is called the art of the money. I'm going to start with the title.Juan gonzález: the art of the money.Juan gonzález: but when we were talking about a book, we were talking about the book before we even began the project...
473|I was in an early-morning shift at one of my local high schools. I could hear my teacher being called over to me and when I looked up I saw that his name was scott. And scott said, "Scott, you've got him. He's a good boy." And I said, "What do the scouts think?" And scott said, "You know, I love you for your boy name, scott." And we were standing there for about 30 minutes with my dad, and it was just a blur. This is how I know the truth about what I saw. And I was talking to scott that night about what he said to me, and he was saying that he had heard that scott had been sent from a mission that he hadn't seen for some time. And he said to me, "That's one of the things that's going on here." And I said, "No, I wasn't told. I'm told it's because he's a scout." And it was a very disturbing story to tell to him, at the time. And I was so shocked by what they had just told me. It really shocked me.The first thing I did was do the research, because I never heard about any of that. I knew what scott had said the night of the incident. So I started looking into it.So I went back through the scout records, and I learned that he was sent from a mission that he wouldn't se...
474|A friend of mine wrote a post in a blog called "Where I am." He said it would be perfect to have my daughter as a senior in high school. He said all my friends that have been in love are now high school friends. I told him I needed to make it into senior year in junior year. We started talking and I told him all the time that I wanted to get his attention to his post and he wanted to see my book.The thing about getting him to read my story is that that's how our dating life starts. He's a bit nervous on the first date and it's because his mom gets a lot of love from her exes. He's kind of insecure about his dating life. He's always thinking about why she's not liking him and now he's in love with her. We have this relationship and our dating history. We are in love. I believe that love has got to be the basis of good relationships. He's a really open man and I think his love for you will be the basis for good relationship. He understands your need and your needs. He's not afraid to tell you how important life is to him. He's always listening and he's open and honest and you cannot let him know that you're doing the right thing and that you just love him unconditionally and that you'll be fine.I think our relationship is always going to start with him wanting to know how good we were before and no...
475|when I was growing up, my dad was an alcoholic. It was around christmas I would go to the movies. But my mom told me she had a lot more friends on tv. I didn't understand what you were doing. She told me your dad was in the hospital and he was dying. I was like, my god. What're you doing?And so on and so forth.Because you were so old, you could not get your father to get his blood count. If he wasn't doing well then he couldn't be able to check in on you. He had his sister who was in prison. So a nurse went to my dad and said, hey, you know, just go out and check in on him. And I was like, it's just too bad a time. I'm so sick, I'm so sick." And she had to go to sleep in the truck and he didn't get home until 4 a.M. And she wasn't going to believe it and she was sick for 30 hours and she couldn't stop thinking about that. Then she went to her doctor and she said, oh, it's just too bad. I've gone through my entire life being sick.But she was doing really good.It was just like, oh, my god. I'm so sick, I'm so sick.Now I realize that her story is a good one because of her sobriet...
476|in january 2010, there was a man walking in the driveway of a house where he owned a gun. The neighborhood kids were asleep asleep when he noticed them. Then a cop pulled up his car and they got out. We had just caught a speeding car. He picked up the gun, pointed it at the car and took a magazine. He also shot the car's brakes. The police said it was because he had a fake gun like that, and that he didn't shoot the car.At that point, a police officer was there, and when he saw a woman walking by on the sidewalk, the guy took the magazine from her and opened it up and pointed it at the woman. The cop shot her six times.The cops were all on the edge of panic, all this time. They thought they were going to get caught and they would call to tell the authorities. They were not. The guy got out and fired at them all.The cops were stunned at how serious that was. The woman ran through the street and got into the car. The cop fired three more shots. The woman was hit in the stomach. The woman ran to the kitchen, where there was a doctor and went to the police for help.Two police officers took her to her car where they shot her in the eye. The man got out and took the magazine. The police said he shot the woman in the hip. The judge denied it. The...
477|In this week's book, I wrote about a story I read about a couple of weeks ago. In that story I had just read an article on how to be a writer. We talked about the basics. And, frankly, I never thought much of the basic concepts beyond the basic facts. It's a great idea because there's a good chance that you could see how they could be changed or enhanced if you'd come before me and read this book. Because i've always been interested in the fact that the basic fact is that when we have a book, when we have some time in our lives, and all of us are talking about what the book is, we need to be looking at it in this very, very broad and very specific way. We need to read it every day, in this very, very narrow way. It's a way of life. And it's not even all that different than, say, you can read this book about how you can write an entire life. It's different than, say, in a few years you can read a story of a life. But that's not some magical version of life. It's not all that different from having a book on the go, in your bedroom or your school library. It's different from having a movie. You'll learn what the film is about by doing it because it's a movie, it's a book and a movie and a movie can be about life. It's a life. It i...
478|I was a middle school teacher when some guy named bob decided to get into my classroom to have a play on my playpen. So he brought a pencil and an envelope into the classroom and started talking to us to get into the game. We were having a playpen of sorts in his classroom and they were playing a piece of paper with a number in the middle. We said, "Ok, this is where we're gonna play this game. How far shall we go?" "So far north, you got that number?" "We'll take down this number then." "Ok, so far that's where you are." "Ok, so where are you going?" "You're down here in a game of go go!" And he had to be right there. So that's when he wrote that number. And we kept asking him questions in the class. "Are you sure you're gonna be playing in a board game?" We were all, 'ohhhhh. Not really. Not really.' He would say, "I'm sure, we're sure. But you're gonna be playing go go now."So that's when I got there. And he was right there in front of me. And he started saying, "How far do you want to go?" He told us how far we were. We took the first step. We kept going as long as we were able to go. So we started moving in line up. We knew where we should move...
479|You saw the train moving down from the station. It had pulled into the station on some level, its speed and speed being too high. It seemed like all the people were looking up at you. You could hear the doors that lead down to the carriage, and if they did not open, you would hear an ambulance being pulled out of some area to help. It had been such a short time. You could feel the train running with all urgency, but then you saw something that sounded like a freight train moving to the next store in town. The doors to the carriage, on the other hand, were open. It seemed like every direction had its train doors. It was obvious that this was a train that was moving from one place to another, and it was not the same as seeing it in that direction. The door to the carriage, once again, was open, and your heart felt like it was moving in a different direction. You felt your thoughts move across the room. You knew that this was it; it was a train that was traveling at an alarming speed. Your heart was filled with fear. The train came and stopped. All the people around were staring, watching the train and the people that were at the door. It was such a frightening sight. The train passed you and pulled into a large square. You saw the doors to the carriage open rapidly with both your eyes, and your eyes, with both your own eyes. "What the hell was that for?" ...
480|The first time I heard that phrase, I was at a party where I was playing some games."I was in a restaurant and I saw a guy holding a small gun. He was shooting at the people who had just gotten shot at. The guy is a white guy and he was carrying a revolver. When I saw him come around the corner I looked up and he was the gun's owner."The shooter was not immediately identified tuesday, according to sgt. Mike miller.Authorities say it's unclear if any of the victims were armed.A neighbor, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the ap he heard a noise around 7:45 p.M. When the shooter opened fire."I saw the shooter getting out of his car and I turned and saw people with their guns drawn. He seemed to be out of place. I heard him say 'it's going to be a long day tonight.' He put the guns down and we ran out," The neighbor said.Miller said he has no idea why the other victims were not immediately identified.An ap investigation found that authorities have received additional information regarding possible second-degree murder, including the gunman's home address.On tuesday, miller said his team will meet with police and try to determine who's responsible for these early shootings, adding that police should also contact his son."His brother is in a lot of trouble. They have been i...
481|i was in my kitchen, a small farm, in a small village.I remember going to the door, and then looking in the open window, and there I was.It was the night before, the start of summer.I was very tired.I remember thinking about how I would like to go home, how I would love to go to this house, and how I would miss it.I thought, 'oh, this house, this house.It would be cool to go to this house.And then, I went to bed.I did nothing.I was still very tired.But then I woke up.When I woke up, I was still alive.My hair was still on my head.And my eyes were still open.My ears were still open.I couldn't stop thinking about this house.I had to wake up and look to heaven.What did I do?I said, "You look so perfect, dad. I want to live like this forever. I want people to think I'm all mine. I want to be my own people. I want to be happy that they won't have to live like this forever."And they told me to get up and go back to bed.I tried to find words, but it was only ...

483|I've been looking for help in an organization for a long time, maybe a decade, and there doesn't seem to be one that can help me. It's just like the way you find yourself. I think that if I didn't like something I wouldn't be here. I love that I'm able to do something that I love and that I do everything right, so that's why I'm so very excited to be with hvu here. When I first came to the university, I was scared to say anything, because I knew I wouldn't get invited because I'm not a very good student. So I got a job with an it company and I was really excited to see what it looked like when I got to the university. The problem came to mind because for a long time I thought I wanted to be in this place. But I didn't see it that way. I was thinking about wanting to be a good part of something that I love. I went to college and I did two more years of college. So that's when I did this really strong course that I'm proud to be a part of, my thesis on the topic of psychology. I was really excited about that. I had always thought that if you're in college, you had to be a genius, but I never saw that as such a big deal in my mind. But I'm grateful that after I got to the college that I became a part of this project. I got a jo...
484|I was talking to an old man who worked at a restaurant in the middle of nowhere. He said that he had found a lot of these books out there on the internet but I didn't know what to do with them. I read the whole thing about the jews that made the english so great. He said that this is a very great book because this is what people who were persecuted by the jews were all about, and it was all about the jews. And he said that it's about all of them and you need to stop looking at them because they are evil. He said that I should stop looking at them because they were all about the jews. And I thought it was interesting. And he said he would pay to have that book published, because that was what he said—that all of their books were about the jews. And I said, "Well, we don't need that." And he was a really good person.But when I spoke to him and I met with him, and he said, "Okay, if I look at what you have to do and there's a lot that you need to do, then I'lllook at what you have to do." I don't know he knew what he was talking about. We talked about all of those things.But for those that have read this, I hope you're familiar with what he was saying.This is his first time writing a book. He's the kind where you'r...
485|You were a young lad growing up in the united states, a kid who had his father's name engraved on his forehead. A man named george w. Bush came from the same family of families that were the cause for my grandfather's name. It wasn't just that the name changed. It really changed my identity. It was that I was the first one that was identified by god as being the one to save the world from an evil being who was trying to destroy it.The fact is that I was born on march 27th, 1971. I was born in california, my father, robert, was the great poet who was a teenager in los angeles and was studying at harvard. I was also on an aa class at the time when I was 17 and I was a member of the aryan brotherhood. I was also a member of the naacp. The naacp stood against slavery. That was a very clear statement to me.Robert was a good boy and a good man. He was in his late 20s at the time and had become a preacher and writer. He liked music in particular. He was a very good songwriter as well. He would sing and write about issues of religion and things like that. It seemed that his life was a very special one.One of the first people I met at the aa meeting was the black poet and singer bill o'connell, who had just left his home in california. O'connell was a great jaz...
486|I have a friend. Her name is rebecca. She came to me recently and she says all the nice things she does. So I was like, how do I give her that? And here she is and so I just said, what's her name? And she gave me the name of rebecca. And that was a great thing for me because I really like her. And i've gotten so many letters from people that I'm like, "Oh my god, it's you!" And I actually started to really care about her and just wanted to give her my name so that she wouldn't want to send me some emails. So, I had this awesome thing called my lady of the lake, a little app called myladyoflakes.Com. And it's like, oh my god, I got to send it to my favorite author, and he sent it to my mom. So, it was in the app, and it was a great thing and i've never even heard of it but, oh my god, I love that. And I think i've never even heard of it because they never sent me my name.So, rebecca's a fantastic writer and writer. She's very kind and kind and kind. She's a great person. And she's always been funny and funny. She's great at being nice and like good. And that's all I can say about her.So, if you are reading this, you can follow u...
487|I think that you are right about that.This week, I was working at a high school with my best friend, a girl and three kids that are all in kindergarten. We were talking about a game: one of five "Champions" For every 1,000 participants. I was having our friend walk into the room with her kids and show them what the top team in the tournament was all about. I took her word for it, she started to talk about the games I played against me, and she immediately told me that I had a lot to study. I didn't know what to do. I was so busy practicing, I didn't even know what I was supposed to do. I didn't know how to make the most out of my experience that night, and I was so afraid that I had no time left. It was like going on a trip. What do you do when you see what other people have done, or how do you cope?When you go the distance from a game to an event, you start to think that maybe there are no problems. There are no distractions. Even if you're not in charge of the event, your responsibility is to make sure everyone is happy. You're not in control of who is playing who, you have no control over how long it takes in the tournament, and you don't have the time or energy to do it all.In fact, if you just try for th...
488|Every time I get a new email from your company in india, I just ask: "How do you feel about this?" I reply: "I am glad you asked." I get a few compliments and then a few email messages. I like that.It's the only way I can tell you how happy my job is.I was once a huge salesman at facebook. A friend gave me a small business phone and the one I kept at my house for the last 20 years. I took that to facebook which turned me into a great person and a big deal. The next day I told other people like this. I went and showed them the business phone and they didn't like it. They didn't like the idea of selling on them.For a while I wanted to buy a business phone and I thought it would be great, not only for my own business but for the family because they were my friends and so I could use them in my business. And they agreed so I went to facebook to find them.I wanted to buy a business phone from facebook and from where? The place. I called for a minute and the man was like: "Hello, are you there? I have a business phone for you so why not check your mobile number and I will get you a copy."Then he asked me if I wanted to buy an iphone 6 and I said yes. He did not know that I was in india, and thi...
489|In 2006, an ad in the washington post asked, "Is there something very wrong with donald trump?" The response was clear: if trump doesn't want to be inaugurated, we've already had enough.A few weeks after that piece was published, I wrote about the same problem on twitter and in the new york times. An article by mark steyn, the ceo of the american enterprise institute, called it "An unprecedented attack on the republican party, a slap in the face to the populist ethos of our country and the promise of a country that is fundamentally different and closer to the spirit of the republican party than any other."Steyn doesn't mean that trump is a xenophobe. I know many of his critics. But his approach is different than his standard approach to other issues. He is a more straightforward character. He likes to see the american people speak out, to be heard, and to understand that as a person, it is the only right thing to do.But he also is more than a character, a conservative thinker. He loves the republican party. His message is clear and is deeply rooted in the american traditions of american conservatism. His ideas have resonated with millions of americans, and that resonated in the 2012 presidential election, as well as the 2012 republican convention and the general election. He is a realist and a realist has to be on his side. It's a challenge. The way to do it is to pu...
490|i was on a mission to find some sort of cure for an unknown disease. It was a terrible disease. It was as horrible as the cold that destroyed most of the people I'd been chasing, a disease that would not have cured me had you known I was still alive. I was trying to save my friends, my family, my friends and my people. I was trying to survive because it was my chance. I had to do something.We were having dinner. I was sitting at a table with my mother when it suddenly felt like one of those things I would never see again: the pain on my arm. You know, a painful arm is a pain. I felt the pain in my arm when I was about to be killed by a cold. So I said, "What kind of pain could I make myself suffer, for my arm and my life?" You know, it was a really hard moment. I looked at my mother and I said, "This is too much, and this isn't going to be a quick fix, because this isn't a problem." And my mother is like, "Oh, you're right, because i've had my arm for so long. You can't just say 'i want to die.' This isn't your fault. This isn't your father's fault."I did not want to die. I wanted to get home. I had been thinking of my mom when I got home from the table...
491|It's a strange story. I'm going to call it the sirens. It looks like a story of two brothers. The brothers are fighting over the lives of the three children under the age of ten. You know, who are they?"The children were one of 16 to be born to the sirens.The oldest, an eighteen-year-old named henry, was born in september of 1778. Henry married a woman named emma, who was a widow. Henry was seven years old when she gave birth to her first son, charles, in february of 1772. The other boys in the family, joseph, harold, and lucy, were born in august of 1779.The only surviving sibling was a sister named margaret, who died in 1779, and the rest were all born in 1791. The only surviving sibling in this family was the third youngest, joseph, born in october of 1788.The family moved to a larger house in the 18th century. While living with the family, the children in the family were left with more children, which led to the deaths of five children and the deaths of eight children. The youngest child was born in october of 1823.The father died of a violent accident. His body was discovered when a train in the vicinity of his house was stopped. The child died from an unknown cause.Henry married another man, who was a man born of good health i...
492|i was a little worried in my first few years of living in an apartment, but it was great; it was a place I could spend time. When I started here in the mid-eighties I was pretty much a teenager and I was taking out all these things so I could get away from the old house and live in this modern apartment where I could go work, play tennis, go to friends' houses and have a nice evening out. This was the first apartment that I had. It was the house in which I went to college, and it was always this very young man, playing tennis with a little girl named jane.The landlord was very nice and I took a break from work and went home. The other landlords were very polite and kind and very nice. I thought I was crazy to go up against them, but I had my reasons.How did you get into tennis?I played tennis. I was a really good player. My sister was an international player and I was just starting to get to know her better. I had a really good time, and I still play tennis.But in the mid-eighties, when you move to a small town in england, there are no tennis courts in the city. And you think, "Wow, that's not just because I don't know about tennis."You don't know about tennis. I played in tournaments in london and in manchester and I watched peopl...
493|You were playing at the time of the bombing. You had a friend and he'd be there waiting for you. I heard you had a black guy named j.J. And he was listening to music. He was playing guitar and I said to him, "Yo, j.J. Wants to play guitar, and you've got me. Go play guitar. You know how that goes." And he went up to him and said, "Hey, j.J. - tell me how you're playing." I was like, "You know what?" He goes, "Well, how are you? Why do you play? It's been so long." And he goes, "It's just my luck." And I just looked at him and said, "Well, I know how it goes." And of course he just went out of his way to help."Amy goodman: the president, when he said this, it sounded like a compliment.David pubers: oh, I think so. And of course, as I mentioned, he was one of the many people whose memories of the bombing remain. He was one of the many who were there.Amy goodman: but you were the one who got the bomb, did you?David pubers: well, I mean, I was the one who did the bombing.

496|On august 13, 1993, I was driving in chicago with my family and my mother-in-law. Her husband was asleep. My mother-in-law's boyfriend, a friend of ours, was in the car with us. They went into my apartment. I was in the car with my girlfriend and my older brother in the car with us and my friend. I got on the ground and heard my friend screaming. I jumped on my seat. Then I heard what could only be called a scream and I rolled up to the driver's side window. His name was bill. He was walking down the street. My brother, my grandmother, my grandmother's grandpa, my great-grandpa had just got out of a car ride. I knew it was my grandmother. We stopped at the bus stop. He said, "My aunt passed away at 70 years-old." I said, "My grandmother's, my great-grandpa's grandmother passed away after all." He said, "My grandfather is in prison. He was shot in front of the funeral home. My grandfather died soon after the shooting. He was buried with honors and honors, and his wife died, too." Then he said, "My brother was out there." And I was looking at my grandmother, and I see my brother is lying on the ground. And she's crying. And my brother is still there at the funeral home. She's doing ok and she's still in pain." An...
497|The story got me thinking about the history of skateboarding—it really got me thinking about skateboarding as a sport. And we were just doing a new show in the neighborhood called the staggy, an outdoor show where you could see different people skating. So I came to our place and we just had people skating. It was like a show that didn't really exist, a show that I grew up playing with. The people were just a bunch of kids, with very little money, so they were just skating. It was great.The staggyyou were in the same building when you first started skating. There were only two of you. My first memory is seeing that thing and thinking, what can I do? But once I got back home and made my way back to seattle, I immediately went to see my parents and they were there. As soon as I got to my parents' house, I went outside and I watched people skate. It was amazing, my parents coul...
498|when I first came to seattle, I was lucky enough to have my own college roommate who was very outgoing. She took me on some amazing trips on my own, like going around to the local farmers market where she was willing to put her arms around me if I wasn't willing.In 2011, I went to her store to pay the rent for christmas and she was excited about the plan to share a christmas tree with her at their store a few miles away. I told her that I wanted a tree just for my christmas, and she thought it would be a great fun idea to decorate the tree with my presents."Really?" She asked."I like to decorate trees for myself." I said.She did and I had my new tree for my christmas.About a year later, I was able to make it to the store and was able to pick out a few items from their holiday stock. I was just glad that I couldn't have to have a bunch of christmas trees for people to use, especially because when you get someone to help you with the project, you are going to want to be sure you are happy with that.While this project has proven to be successful, it has also made me realize just how much fun and creative I am! I was excited to make it when I was about to go out for dinner with my new friends and I was reminded of many projects and things along th...
499|My mom was a nurse, a nurse on maternity leave, who died when I was 16. I was a part of that nursing team in my junior year and I was working with a nurse in a hospital nursing unit, and I'm the nurse. I was a part of the team that gave my little boy polio, a smallpox vaccine. So, we worked together, and my mom was so good with the kids and with the staff, but I was still the nurse. My mom wanted me to be a nurse, that's her idea. I was a nurse because she loved me.When it comes to my son with polio, I was never a nurse, never a member of the team. And while I do still have some memories of that, the most recent is I was just 12 years old. I remember working with a local group that did a bunch of things to aid in the recovery. Our group was at about the same time we heard about the polio epidemic from the parents they knew, and we talked to them about the importance of giving every child in their family the right to participate in the school. And at the end of the year, the parents decided to give me something I still do, which is my family's education, and I was a part of that team, and I was happy to do that.Are you the only one where you've got this story to tell?Yeah, I'm the only one where it's not...
500|One moment I was out there doing the first round of a tournament, with a bunch of guys I knew that I should take care of, with me being the no. 1 guy. And then one night, it was five guys I knew that he should put on his best clothes, he'd go with his best friend to the show. And so I was out on stage and the guys were all laughing. We'd been on stage with our best friends. I remember talking to them, and they thought, "I'm going to go with a girl. I'm going to be the best girl in the world, and I'm gonna get the best girl in the world." So I go and they told me "We have two guys of the best friends, and we have two very good girls. Can we put them on?" So I went, "Yes," And that's how I came into the booth. I went, "What?" And they said, "We have two guys of the best friends, and we've got three good girls." So I was like, "No, I'm a girl. I'm the best." And I was like, "You're going to go. No." So I got into the booth and I was like, "That's it. I'm going to win the next game." I went, "No, I'm going get the no. 1 guy. No." So that's how I knew I could win the next round...
501|That my parents divorced when I was seven and I spent the early '80s and early '90s going around the west coast. They bought me a house near the airport and started looking for a place to live. When I got to high school it was just on the west coast. And that was about the time of the dot com boom of the late '90s. Now I live a couple of miles away from them. They put me in a room with a tv in a corner. And then I got out of there and moved to a nearby airport in the u.S.A. And here I am, with the only two things I own that are in my pocket, on their behalf -- to travel to my family's home in oregon. These are very beautiful homes that have three bedrooms and a bathroom. And I'm really excited about living there.Why do you think the west coast has become so popular?I think it's what makes it unique. We live in an amazing community of people, both old and new. The west coast is known for its history, it's very diverse. It's made of two continents, but the people of oregon, oregon state, and oregon have that unique identity that I think was a good thing for oregon in the first place. I feel like it's like a great home. There are no better homes than those places, so I think that they provide a unique place for me to live.Ca...
502|I met a guy who was in a club called jocks. He had a nice club in his room. He was a big man with a big body, like a golf buddy. I said, "Okay, let's move out of here to be with you." "Okay, let's move to the club." He told us that he had a girlfriend named jill. He called me and asked me to see the girl. I went to her apartment and I told the girl, "You need some help. I'm an older guy. Do you know where I can get some help?" I said, "I know where." "Okay, if I can help you, what would you like to do for me?" She said, "I like to be with you." He said, "I want to be with you two." I said, "You can get me some new clothes and a car and I'lllet you drive me to the club." He said, "You want to join my team? I can get you that. Go to the club and go play football for a week and then you can go to your team and be with me." He said, "We're the one in the club, so I'llget you my old car and the rest can be yours. I can help you." "I really need that. I'm not getting any help from you or anything like that," She said. He said, "I'm a little disappointed. It'...
503|i was just doing my homework, when I found this.There was a girl named alice.There was a girl named rufus.Then this girl came up to me.There was something.I had to be sure she was there.What was it?I didn't know, but I thought of the girl, and how she looked at me.I thought of all this time.But then I thought of the only thing I knew about that girl.It was my daughter.She stood up and grabbed my hand, and said, "If you don't do it, I will have nightmares all day."I got up and said, "I will be ready to go."The girl said, "You know what? It's not about that."I said, "Of course it's not about that."She shook her head."No, it's just something that happens," She said. "My first thought was when you say that I'llbe ready. Now, you know, I'm not worried about that now. In fact, I will be ready and ready until you tell me how you feel about me."I said, "Of course you're not worried about that if you don't want to do it. I know what it's like being a monster in your own family...
504|I have just been driving from oklahoma to the middle of the state and then my truck stops in the middle of the road. I'm driving up to what appears to be the best price that they have ever sold me. So I tell the driver, this is a truck like you can never get anywhere at what price, but they tell me, 'i guess you can pick this up for about $250 to $500 dollars. So this is for the best price. What can you pay for it?' So I tell that driver, this looks like a truck like you could for sale. And he says, 'no, that is very good. You know, this is something that you don't want to pick up. We will take care of it.'"In a phone interview at a town hall meeting last summer, he told the crowd, "When you put the money down, all you want is to get it back on. I'm going to give this up. You know what? I'm ready to sell to you."That same year, the new york times reported that amazon had paid a $40 million to settle an antitrust lawsuit stemming from the sale of a computer program that automatically sent and received payments to members of its e-commerce service. Amazon was paid $1.5 billion for the deal, while the times reported that an amazon official had told the newspaper that the company was willing to "Put it off," And that if amazon bought a product, i...
505|well, it has been a long time since I wrote this chapter.I can't believe the people are so proud of me.I got so excited about this scene because I got a hint of what would happen to me in the next chapter.After that, I would think about the future I wanted to live in for a long time.What you said was true…but it's not true at all, right?That's right.In my past life, the dream I had was that I would become a magician and a writer.But I got this idea when I first read this book that this dream was in some kind of bad state at the end of my life.That's right…but the dream I got from here and now…is the future I want to live in."I am the future I want to be…or at least, I am the future I want to live in.""You don't understand.""I understand. Not in this book, but in my personal life. I am happy that I am happy. I have been blessed to know how to be happy. And that I am happy. There is no better feeling than happiness."I'm sorry about that.""And I am happy that I am happy.""Then how do I know that I am happy?""I am ...
506|One day I found out that the fbi had been spying on me in the name of protecting the clintons. I didn't know that at the time. I had been using the alias "John podesta," But then it turned out that I had met hillary clinton at a meeting with her husband at the white house. The fbi was aware at the time that my husband had a private email address and there were three of them. And as I was trying to figure out what was going on with hillary clinton, I started to feel very guilty. The fbi knew that my husband wasn't a government informant. The fbi said, "Well, the only thing that matters is what is going on with hillary clinton, so that's why they had to find out. My family, we're going to make a case for you." And on that day, my husband showed up on his knees to tell them that I had been doing that. I said, "Why don't you tell me what I can do to help her?" They said, "Well, if you don't like that and you're not going to be doing it then I'lltell you that you'll always do it. Do it at your own risk." That was the first step.So how did that work out for you?Well, my dad was on one of those classified military airplanes that we were flying out of. After we got to this little place, we flew over there and it was very cold and we...
507|I was 16 and my sister was 12 at the time. I went upstairs with my mom and dad and we didn't have a car, so I walked upstairs because I always hated running away from home and having my things. My mom would say you're supposed to be running away for your life because you're the one who's going to break in and steal everything. So I went in one day and I ran into her mother and she thought I was running. I said, 'i ran away from home because you're the one who's going to get everything.' She said, 'no, I'm not running away from home because I do your shopping.' And I was like, 'no, this is how it is.' And she said I was trying to steal money and then, you know, she came right down and told me I needed to do this to show that I was a criminal, you know, because I had done something bad. I'd taken money for her and my sister. And I had never done anything bad in my life. I was running my life the right way. And my whole life.Amy goodman: you've said that you're not a criminal. You're married to a woman. You live in a home with you two. How do you define a real criminal?Robert becklett: this is my wife. I don't see the difference here, obviously. I think it's not a question of la...

509|I was sitting at my desk. I had a copy of that book and I said to myself, wow that's a story. We did this a little while back, and one day I put that book up back in the attic. I was sitting there with that copy and they were writing a letter to the editor because some people knew the book and thought they knew its title. It was a story about a boy and his mother and a dog. There were some things that I wrote on that book. So I was kind of thinking, I don't wanna write that. I didn't want to make a list. I was just looking at it and trying to figure out if I could write a whole story. Then I noticed that it was on the first page of the book. Then I found out about the story, and I found out about that story the next day.I had read it a lot and I didn't know what to expect from it, it wasn't one of these sort of stories. I wanted to write and I wanted it to be a mystery kind of story and it was.I remember writing that book. I was like, man, I really didn't know anything about this book so I didn't know what to expect. [laughs.]at the same time, I was thinking about what my dad, my friend, the friend of my friends and all the others would be thinking about. I was thinking, what do I write tha...
510|It's how this guy, at 23, did it. He started it, and they didn't give me a reason for why. What they gave me was they wanted an opportunity to take me on. And, in the end, they took it. I didn't give them a reason because i've been working here so long I just want to be here."And he never got a job doing anything for a living."That's one of the big mistakes you do," He says. "You ask your wife: 'what can I do for this opportunity?' I say, 'what can I do?'"He also gets a lot of support from his sisters."I was always pretty happy and I'd say that was my first job," He says. "I was getting all this love from all that kids, you never know what you're going to see." He even has a crush on his brother, who is also an astronaut.But he was never really a fan of the american space program. And yet, he took a job for a living working with the russians in december 2004. He says he's glad all the money he's earned is going to the u.S. So he wants to get back to russia and start making an impact."We can take advantage of that for the american people and for our country," He says. "This is the american dream. That's our dream. It's goin...
511|I was on the same flight, and I saw the plane and looked over the seat beside me. It was the same black girl that was waiting next to me. She looked at me and said, "I just noticed you're sitting next to my seat. You think you're a friend?"I started talking to her and it turned out she was in fact, a fan favorite, and i've always liked it. I didn't think about it much back then when I first met her and she started being an ambassador to me. "I've known you for like four years now, and I guess i've seen my fair share of good things," I said. "It's been really good."I didn't take that into consideration that she'd been with me for years. We were on the same flight. She was just another of my friends. I went to the airport, and we met after about 4 p.M. I couldn't believe it! I never thought I'd never met anyone like her.I didn't know what to expect. I knew she'd like me! I knew she knew where I went from here! I knew that she was in love with me, that we didn't have kids, but that she was still a cool girl with fun stories to tell. I knew she didn't think I was cool, but that I was cute, which was definitely the only reason that I met her.I went to chec...
512|at a party in new york, we were taking our pictures. We got together to film it, and it came out, the first picture in a year. It wasn't really until people saw it with their friends that we realized it had to be a one-shot. We looked at the video, and as a couple of months later we put it up in the internet.So the idea was, if we just went to a restaurant and got these really good photos of us, we could just go into a party and shoot it together, right? And if you really dig what this thing was that you wanted to photograph, like having a big party and then talking to these strangers, then you might think, "How will I get a lot of pictures?" And I think, "Well, maybe I can make a lot of them, but I don't want to take them all up."We didn't come up with the concept of "Making of" Or "Making of a movie." It was just, "I want to make something that people think will be exciting and fun. I want to look cool on the big screen." Well that was something that we really had to figure out from the photos.So, from there, we shot two things.The first time, when I was making "All of us" At the time, we made it into our film. And then we got some very, very lucky friends. Yo...
513|The first time I saw this trailer was just after the first movie in my life.I was at the theater where I was getting ready to go to dinner. It was an 18-year-old boy sitting there with a band and I was like, "Mommy, this is crazy!" He was like, "This has been so long since I was a kid and I don't remember what it was like before. All I know is I was a kid!" And so I sat there with my head down and I said, "Why?" And he said, "Because it was so long." He said, "I've been so busy with work, all day i've been thinking about how long this movie is going to last." So it was very stressful for me in that moment.I was thinking about how long I thought this would be going to last, how much I wanted to keep going, and the most important part of this movie is I wanted to play my mom. So I ended up making another movie. That's when I was really close to losing my mom. She was just dying of cancer, I just couldn't put her in better hands.It's always hard to say what to do when a project like this is in the past, but it's a nice thing to see how the industry has react to your projects.If you had to make something like this, how would you feel about the way it was handled o...
514|a young woman was having trouble sleeping and sleeping in tents at the time. She said, "Well, you should make a bed. I'm sure you can take care of it." That's when the man started to move into the tent.She and the girl walked to the tent and said, "Come in! It is a tent. No furniture. Just sleeping." He jumped out, and we heard and we watched him, and he opened the tent and said, "You can stay. There are some kids here that don't trust you."The woman and the girl were taken to the camp and there they found the kids that had been sleeping there. They told me one of them was sleeping on the floor of the tent. So we put them in each tent and I told them how we were gonna make them a bed. The other one was asleep a little bit under the tent. So they let him sleep down in those tents and put him in the tent.That's where he went in. Then he was ready to go in. He said, "Come in on the bed. It's a tent and you can get away with it. You can take care of it. It's just a bed. And we'll take care of it. We won't take care of it by taking it. It's not like we did, you know. We'll take care of it." And the boy said, "Good job. Ca...
515|It happened. When I was at the beach in california, I was up with my friends and we had a couple drinks, and he walked us into his room and I looked through the wall. He was dressed and looking at me, looking at his phone, but I couldn't believe he was looking at it. He was doing this, he was looking at my phone a little bit. And we were really upset. We had this kind of moment on the beach, and we were about to go to the beach. He said, "What are you doing here?" And I was like, "Ooh, I'm sorry I got out of that here!" I was like, "Ooooh!" And he was like, "Well, you can't say that, you gotta say it. He called and he was like, "Ok. Tell your mom." And my mom said, "Mom!"So I did what I always do, and I went outside and we walked around and found a really nice beach. We were really worried. I'm not sure if he even called his mom, but he called her and said, "Did you go to your mom's?"He was at a restaurant right now. He was trying to get a drink from a guy he met on snapchat. He texted me saying, "What are you doing here?" And I said, "I'm doing a beer." He said, "I'm just going to go to m...
516|When the fbi raided my home in new orleans, I was sitting in the driveway holding papers, waiting for my husband to finish his papers. I had my wife with me that morning, and at first it felt like an adventure, as if I just ran out of time to do something. But after a minute, she said, "I didn't see you. It's your car." I tried to explain, but she said, "Let's get him to the front of the car." I don't know how she knew I had done that. But I knew, and when I asked her later with a smile, "What's wrong?" She said, "It looks like she's upset, she's angry, it's not what I want to see." This is what I saw.That's all that happened to me. The first time I checked my bank account, I didn't have an account with a bank. I was at a motel at the time, I had one, and I went to the bathroom to flush the toilet and clean the toilet. I went on my way, and I left the room. I had an empty cell phone, and I had never asked for a picture, so I called my partner. And then a second call, and I heard my girlfriend walk out of the room and that she was very, very upset. And I said, "What did she say?" And she said, "I'm sure she's upset. She want...

518|I am a retired colonel in the u.S. Army reserve corps. I'm a retired combat officer. I have been the target for the terrorists. I was working at the u.S. Army, and I was fired out of my house for my service. Because of the lack of training, I couldn't get a job at all, and my first job was in kabul. And so, I went through the training, which ended up being a lot of mental preparation for the job, for our military. I went to a good school. I went to a good university. I was not able to work and I started living there. I started getting sick and in pain from the headaches, so I came back with my mother and we were living there for a year at the time. She gave me a job that was really much better. And then, when I got discharged from the army, I went to the u.S. Army as a member of the 82nd airborne combat team and I took all the training and was able to do everything I could to be a combat officer. And in terms of what I'm talking about here, I was a service member and i've been assigned to combat service since january of 2008.What did you get to watch that was that you were assigned to combat mission, as well?Well, I have a couple of experiences on this. You know, I was stationed at camp lewis before I left. You kno...
519|the first thing I realized was that some of what is happening was just not right. If you're a black woman, and you're an immigrant and you're working for an immigrant company to produce the sort of clothing we would expect, then you're going to have a hard time getting it right because there'll be problems with the production schedule, and that's exactly what I'm telling you, because you can't just give up the opportunity.If you work in a factory where your labor isn't really fair, you're going to be punished. And then you're going to struggle against this situation, and I have no idea how you manage it. I'm sorry about this. In the future, if I were to speak to an immigrant company that wants to produce clothes and it says to stop producing, it's going to have to stop. And this industry, they're not going to get through without the labor of other workers. So now, you've got to find something to work with. So even if you've tried, if you went to work on a field site or a garment factory, and the government didn't want you to be able to work on those things, there's no justification for you, and you can't.So if you worked in factories that were unfair to you or discriminated against you, then you're going to have to struggle. And to find something to work with, you'll still have to deal with the realities of lif...
520|My dad gave me a gift when I was 4, that was the first birthday gift I ever got. This was before my mom got ill, and I had to get up and do a lot of homework, and my mom was like, "I got this one." So, my dad got me that one when we were two years old. He gave me that one.I grew up to be a very athletic kid, but that year was a pretty big one, and I ended up winning four games for the ducks. It ended up being a long season for both of me, but all of that came from good coaching and a very important year for both of us.I just had to grow up in a city that was very supportive for me. So far, I'm really proud of what both of us accomplished together. And I'm grateful for that.What is the season like for all of you?It's been quite tough. My schedule with the ducks is very similar to mine. I've been on a lot of different teams and things had to change that have a lot to do with college football, so i've probably had a bit of time to reflect on and find my way back into it.I think about this stuff very often as my dad and my mom went through it. As you know, being seniors, my mom was very worried when she put me on their team that I was going to be a freshman and the...
521|It was in the early morning hours of march 6th, 2010 and I was standing on a street in the north side of atlanta. I walked into a building. I started to walk to my apartment. I ran. You know, it was the only police stop I could see. I got out of my car. I just got on the ground. And I heard people screaming and screaming and screaming. And I was like, "What the hell are you doing down there?" And I heard the police responding. And then I was driving home from work. And I heard the officers screaming, and I saw the guy sitting on the ground in the middle of the street. I was so mad. So I don't know what they were talking about. I'm not entirely sure, but I did hear some screaming. And I didn't even have time to get up.One minute I was sitting at the desk, and the other minute I was sitting on the floor, and the officers started to say, "Get on the ground! This is not a fight." And I said, "Get over there! We're going to arrest you!" And one of them said, "I want you to help us." I said, "No, we're going to arrest you." And they kept saying, "No!" I was like, "No!" I went. I walked. I was just looking at the sky. I couldn't believe it. I could see the ground...

She said, "No, I'm a princess!" And after a few minutes, we were married.My girlfriend said, "You see, you know I was born to serve. I serve you."I said, "No. I'm proud of you." I was a princess so I could serve you.And then I didn't serve you. I was a mother, an english teacher.I came from a family with a large family that was also married with children. I'm a huge fan of mary shelley and her stories. I love them. They are wonderful worlds, even if they are not complete.It was in the middle of my wedding anniversary. It was at the very end of an epic. And the bride was just sitting there with her hands wrapped around her hips.After the wedding, I came home and I was like, "You know this girl, she's so beautiful! I love the way she looks, the way she walks, or the way she kisses and hugs you."And to celebrate my daughter's 20th birthday, I got a call.

523|You were with my dad in ohio for the last 20 years. It was a great time. My father got divorced and he left me with two sisters and a baby. I was like a little boy. I had two brothers, and they were really good on me…i was playing baseball every day and playing with my brother. He was like, 'listen, you wanna hit these balls, please.' He was like, 'listen, I know you don't want me to hit these balls, but please, just hit these balls, and I'm gonna play with you like a child.' He was like, 'that's what I meant. That's what I meant.'"And it was a good time, because you could see how my dad was working with the kids, and that was a positive opportunity for me."I was like, 'how do you think this kid got that?'""A lot of times you hear the people saying, 'i don't think you can make them laugh at you.' It's like, 'what?' He was always saying, 'i don't think you can play. I don't think you can play. I don't think you can make them laugh at you.' It was fun, but it's not a good time for me right now."One of the more important aspects to consider is where the relationship could go if your sister is pregnant, and how a baby was conceived and delivered...
524|I was working at the time, and I heard a man coming over and saying, "Oh, there's this dude up there that you wanna find out what. He's wearing glasses!" I said, "Oh, no, no. I just want to know what you think." And he started going, and I went back and there was this man, this old guy, who was wearing sunglasses. And I said, "Yeah, you look like it's gonna be really hard to go back to school, man, this guy's got glasses." And he said, "Yeah," And I said, "Well, you know what? If you're going to learn your lesson and become a better person, I want you to tell me what you think is right." And we went back to school, you know, and we found out how good glasses are. But, of course, we couldn't figure it out, and in the end, we had to go through a lot of work to get the glass works from a guy who was wearing glasses on the bus that we had at the time. And it wasn't pretty because he had the first experience with a glass works that we had, I think, he came up with the idea of putting a glass on his head instead of a guy in a hoodie because it didn't hurt so much, but it did hurt pretty badly.So, you know, the idea that somebody doesn't realize their value is actually a bi...
525|I work for a group of friends who are both engineers who've spent their lives building the internet. It takes a lot of energy to do the things we do, and we think there is no better way to do it.I'm part of that group of engineering students. I have a good relationship with them. When I talk to them about their work I always ask them the same question: how do you live your life in a world that values good engineers and good workers, and has never allowed them jobs?They are very interested in the question. I'd imagine that is the most important question they have. I am. The engineering students are like a team of engineers. We're all the developers. We share a lot of stuff in common, but we all share the same values: value work and value a bit more.We live in a world where you have to compete on a daily basis in order to get what you want. You have to be willing to make sacrifices when you make the best decision.We all have a responsibility to understand that the more we are willing to go the longer we will be able to live this kind of life.One of the key reasons why engineers have been given so much credit are their love for their work: the feeling it gives to everyone around them.You can see that in the video below and also in the interview with me. I love it. The video opens about a month o...
526|I lived in india for four years from 1990 onwards. I travelled all the time, I did a lot of writing, I had some of my own. In my late twenties I worked with my parents and some of the other family members at the bbc. In 2001 I got my first job and was promoted back to managing the bbc, so I worked in the offices of the international broadcasting corporation. My first bbc job was in 2001. I'd recently moved out of delhi and went to live in dubai, so I'd seen a lot of the same problems as before. We had some problems with our financial situation and the people had got into real trouble and had been forced out of our homes.When I met the staff members of bbc i-uk, we worked extremely hard and it had made it difficult for us not to work. My first job is now at the bbc. I've been working with the bbc for two years now. One of the problems for the bbc is, they have to keep up with the demands of the working classes. It's becoming very difficult to manage this. The pressure has become very much on me and my family.I was able to get a loan for some of the bbc staff and I worked on many projects and I did make a few hundred pounds. I'm happy in the studio because you get the chance to get a chance to work with people and you can see that they're not giving up. Many people think that you're a...
527|I was living in a house in new orleans. It was just one of the very few places that was truly open to the public. There was no other information on the internet about the streets, no public transport. I don't think i've ever been to a place without a water source because it was so isolated from the sea. This place was a very safe place and at the same time protected by laws that were intended to prevent it from becoming a crime scene. As an environmentalist, I couldn't do anything. But I was able to make people think that it was very much open to the general public. It was just as vulnerable to contamination if you don't talk to them about it as you are.What did you do when you were growing up there?I lived a pretty normal life before I moved home. I got into college and became a lawyer. As I got old, I had a couple more years of law practice. My wife and I were very close. I don't think we have any other relationships. We live in a big apartment. I don't know who was in charge of the apartment or who was in charge of the house. It was kind of like being a child. Our parents lived in one of the two houses where I went to school. Our mom worked in the kitchen and my best friend was with my younger brother. She was the only person who saw us as kids.What kind of life did you grow u...
528|on the day of the first democratic debate, hillary clinton was talking about how she would fight to keep her name from being featured on tv news cameras. While she had only been nominated for president a few weeks earlier, I would have never imagined how much she and her team would feel about her running mate. How much we could lose. How much we would lose. And how hard it would be.That day, with bernie sanders, there was still a long way to go.I am a man of integrity. I am strong in truth and truthlessness. I believe I am stronger in honesty and truth than ever before -- and I can stand up to the system as an individual against the system and the system. And, if bernie sanders is elected to the white house, I will fight for it.But this was an opportunity. And that's why I have no choice.There are no answers now. No way. There is no way I will be able to do everything i've been asked to do. That means I have no option -- including on what to do.The clinton campaign gave me a platform. I wanted to make my message a reality. It was as simple as that. But as I sat on stage, listening to the speeches, the television ads, the rallies, listening. And I kept listening.That is why i've stood up. I want to stand up against the system. I always hav...
529|You saw my son on the street when he was 4 years old. He was lying on his stomach and he said, 'you've taken my son." I turned around to see my mom, who was smiling and didn't look at me, and she shook her head. I looked at my son and she said, "I didn't mean anything to you, I just wanted to do something for him." And she said, "I want to make sure you know what I did for your son." So I did it. I'm not an attorney. I have a case law license in new york, and I'm the only one who's represented these boys that are brought to trial as adults." So we did the case, and he's a jury trial. So I have the case, but I'm in new york.Jackson: well, he got a $10,000 verdict. And as you mentioned he will be tried in the new york state supreme court for an adult. So I think this case is about fairness and I'm really excited to get out there and speak to you all.Maddow: you've done something very interesting for them, too, by doing an interview with the new york times that's very similar to what you did before. And that's about a third of the way through and you're talking about this very young man who lost his mother. He's 6 years old and he was diagnosed with leukemia, and h...
530|This was my last day working with the simpsons. I was at a comedy club. You know, there was this guy named george, who was a big kid. He looked like he was trying to kill someone. I was very curious because he was a kid when I was in california (laughs) and here I was at my home in washington dc. He took me into his apartment and started talking to me, and I was like, "What is this, you gotta talk to him?" Then, you know, when he said, you know, "I think I am gonna talk to you," I just said, "What's in his book?" He said, "What is in homer's book?" I said, "Who's homer?" And he was like, "Homer." And then you are like, "Really?"I got home and sat down on the couch and watched the simpsons. It was a great experience. Everything changed very quickly. I had a couple of kids, I had this huge couch. I was like —what's that?Yeah, I had a big couch that I had to use to sit down. I took things out, put down the television, and just had some drinks, and then I saw people sitting there. It looked like I was talking to people, and I was like, "Who is this guy?"Well, it sounds funny to say it because when the show starts, there will b...
531|As a 15th-grade student, I was walking around the campus last weekend. As I turned around, I found two people waiting for me in the parking lot of a bus station. One woman was a teacher with a big boy and had just given birth to a baby. I looked at one of her students and exclaimed, "Honey man, you're doing this for the right reason!" She immediately stopped me. "What if she doesn't get pregnant?" I told her and said, "What if she does?" She looked at me and said, "Maybe you'll put your hands on her body and you're going to have a baby." My response was to cry, "What if I did but you won't? Wouldn't you be happy if you did? You won't feel like a mother anymore." It took me a while before she started crying. I said, "I love you, really. I love you, and that makes me happy. I think every girl has a voice." As the next day dawned, a nurse called me. She felt a baby coming and asked me, "Are you okay?" I said, "I'm fine," And said, "And I can see where you're coming from, too." I said, "What's wrong?" She said, "I got a little bit of a head injury. I was in a car accident at the time." She said, "You were sitting in front of your son. Tha...
532|I went to a hospital with a heart attack in april and my condition is going to be different from my condition now. I'm going to go into a nursing home and my heart is going to be fine. I'm going to get my treatment within three months and my heart is going to continue to last and I will be able to get my life back on track."If you don't care about those things, how can you know what really happened? There are things you can do to prevent it from happening. The truth is most of the time, a lot of things can change your life. But you're not going to be able to be 100% happy if you're not making good decisions for yourself."You can't just make things better, and we all have to keep making them better for ourselves because those things happen to most of us. But it's easy for yourself to have an addiction. Your life depends on the way you react to those situations. And that's why I'm very sorry for what's happened to you that I say today.""Doing good for yourself is not possible. You have to know you do great things for yourself. It's not about going crazy. It's about doing the things you're doing and going from there. You can't get to this stage. If you want to keep putting yourself in control, then you have to stay in control. You have to believe in yourself and know that you'r...
533|When you started, you thought, "Oh, this is really cool. This can do with a little bit of work and a little bit of luck, but I think it will be the best piece of software on the market to date." This is where things ended up.It's hard for me to say anything, but it's what i've learned from this one application where I built a single unit which works, for all intents and purposes, as a single command and I couldn't be happier.I've also learnt some great things as a developer and one of the great things about the company is that it takes time to get things working, and that this was something I wanted to show you what it was and how you can learn from it. And the results so far have been amazing...
534|I worked for a year in san francisco, and I was looking for a job. My company was in san francisco, and my employer had an office. We had been talking for a year and a half, and I got a call from my boss. In an hour or so, I saw an interview for the role, and he said, "I'm a consultant, and i've always worked on real estate and the like." And I said "Ok, let's move on."So, I was doing a bit of work in downtown, and a guy called me up, and he looked like he said, "Are you a consultant?" And I said, "Oh, no, I'm not a consultant." And he's like, "You're a consultant. You've been working on real estate for a year, and this is your first job." And then he went, "I've done a few projects here, and I can't think of one that's better than that." And I was like, "That is a really good question." I asked him all this little details, and it was like, "These are things the consultants have to know, because they are consultants, they're not consultants but they are consultants, and the job's yours. You're not allowed to use your real estate to sell it." And I said, "Well, so what are the things i've seen that make you an expert in this field, you know, wh...
535|We were driving in the south end of chicago. The people I was talking to were black, but my father said there were a lot of hispanics here. I asked the driver if he was hispanic and he wouldn't answer that because I didn't know he was hispanic or I was hispanic, but I was listening carefully and he said he was hispanic and I was hispanic. We went to the grocery store and were going by the way.This guy was wearing a white tie and he was carrying a black bag of money. He said he had been waiting for a cab out of chicago so he had got out of the car, and he said, "We gotta drive, you can't get past the cops. Just give us enough money." And this other guy was holding a piece of money and he said, "We gotta get you here by midnight tonight to get this guy out of here." And I said, "Yes, I did."I'm saying to myself, "Well, that guy was telling the truth in that he got all the money that he was being owed, it's a good idea. He got the bag. I got the money and he got it. And that was all I had left."A lot of other people in the parking lot just took it as a joke. So I left, I had a very nice black friend of mine who was a cop who had been with a lot of other cops for 15 years, probably 20 o...
536|We were standing there with a man who had been shot. I am not a christian. I am a sikh. I have never had any problems with my fellow citizens and I am ashamed of it. I am going to come back and say that I did not tell him to shoot. The police will find that out but now that is not the point. If this is what is going on, then this man is not a person of the faith who had no problem with people shooting at him. We have every right to stop, but not to shoot. The point is the police should stop.What do you think?What have you said in support of the shooting at khan and other sikh men?There have been reports of people shooting at sikh men and women and there are reports of a couple of people shooting at sikh women and girls. I am not a christian. I have never had any problems with my fellow citizens. If this is what is going on, then this man is not a person of the faith who had no problem with people shooting at him. We have every right to stop, but not to shoot.Do you feel that you have been denied your right to freedom because you do not believe in the bible?There is one word for that and I don't think I have ever been denied the right to freedom. If christians have the right to the freedom to choose what religion they believe and what religion they believe in I am sur...
537|The first thing that I noticed when I was working at my high school was how quickly the student body was moving to the left side of the room. The student body that was at the right was moving to the right very rapidly. I think the first thing I noticed was that this wasn't even a thing. They were moving to the left side of the room as fast as they could. This was their second floor office, where they'd have a computer, which they put in there, and these two men had their computers on each side. They'd switch between three different computers. It was amazing. I was watching their computer, and people were moving. I'd say, "This is a great computer, but it seems to be missing something."After working with them for 10 years, what I remember most about your first experience at mit is how much of this was your own personal experience. They had people who were doing it as an agent of choice. They'd be working with computers for a certain term or whatever and you'd ask them their thoughts. They would think, "I know I'm doing this right now, how do I get this right?" I'd sit there and just walk along, and they'd say, "Oh, I'm not seeing the problem now. Why does this problem come up?" And I would look up at them, and I'd say, "Well, that's just the way that they are," And they'd answer, "Do...
538|an entrepreneur who is very good at what he does isn't actually the best at anything and does it with such ease he has no real power over what he does.So, even in the company of someone who is very good at everything, he's still working as he can as fast as he can pull it together and he's still trying to make something good out of it. The problem is that when he gets his hands on it, he is so slow that it's all very easily broken up into small pieces that he has to keep working hard and it takes him a long time to figure out what he needs to do.The other problem is that when we're all in the business of building things, we don't really need a lot of time to get it done. If we're all in the business of building things, there's no need for us to really do much more than focus on getting things done quickly, and when it comes to building things, it's really not very good.This is the problem that I'm talking about. When we've built things for four or five years, we still don't know when it's going to be time to start rebuilding the business. When we've built things for a year, it's like our business is starting to collapse for some reason, as we get better at making things we think we can get better at.And that's exactly what happened to me when I decided to star...
539|I had a conversation about it with him in the hallway of the dorm.He talked about the time he got fired.I remember him saying, "I'm sorryi was just very sad about it."And that was exactly what I thought.That's kind of my view of it, and it was that kind of feeling.I guess it didn't hit any of us....
540|I was born and raised in seattle. On a saturday, I was in the gym at my local high school wrestling camp. In my little town, I didn't know much about wrestling. I was 5 years older, and I started wrestling to make ends meet. I wasn't particularly good at it, but I had the best days. I liked it and I had a lot of fun. I was really good at it, and I was a champion.I started working out when I was 3. I started competing every week in the gym, but I was just a little too good at it. In my head, I would say now that I am one of the best in the world at my wrestling training camp. I'm at the level where people are telling me I'm amazing, and I have some great dreams. I love it. I'm going to be training at another venue this year if only to keep doing it.When I was 6, I fell into depression. I felt miserable, because there was just no way to escape it. I told myself that I would never go back, and I never would. That was when I started playing video games and watching pokemon go. I knew that if I didn't go somewhere, I would never be able to meet people again, I would just think about everything I did, because I had no idea what to do. I thought I would never be able to do anything. I didn't know what to d...
541|You're all in college and everything is going great, you're trying to do a couple jobs to make ends meet, you're doing good and you're being a great company owner. But the reality is, you're all in college and all you have to do is do your college degree. And as an example, you know, you have to have two jobs as a stock trader and a financial executive, and you're supposed to make a living by doing those two jobs. So this is a job that is so far from reality because of the reality that most of us don't have.Bill moyers: well, no doubt there still are those who will say, okay, what about you? And i've just asked the question—there is no truth in it, I thought. And I don't think there is anything wrong with that.Juan gonzález: so you're doing the job that's not what the average person is supposed to do.Narrator: no, no, no, that doesn't matter. So what's wrong with it? There's no right answer. There's really no right answer. You know, you're all in college and you're trying to do two jobs that are so far from reality because of the reality that most of us don't have. I mean, we all do the job that's supposed to be done. So to say that the average person isn'...
542|It happened last sunday. I walked into the offices of the department of health and human services. They were talking about something about the death of my son. They had me interviewed at the hospital. I was at the office, and by the time I arrived, she had been given a diagnosis of a cancer. Then, one of the nurses went into the office. She was shocked, and said, "How did that happen?" And I said, "I don't know. I don't have time to explain it to you. I just assumed that she might not be alive. She had no idea what she was doing."Q: what did you think the nurses were saying, in the er?A: from the first second, I thought that the nurses were saying something to me like, "This is so important. You really need to know what it is, where it's going. You need to get her to her own house. You need to know if there is a way that we can help you if you need help. We are not going to take your life. If the hospital told you and your wife would get sick and you wouldn't get any help, and you'd have to take the doctor's place, you wouldn't get any help. It was a terrible feeling. And I knew it wasn't good. I was like, "What is it?"Q: you have said, "I didn't care if he died but i...
543|One of my most important and much awaited projects is that I'm writing a book about my own life as a writer. I'm living up to the expectations of my parents and they have been through it a couple of times and they've said they want me to tell my story and not just talk about the things I'm writing about, but how they have dealt with it. I mean, I'm a writer; i've written a number of novels, I wrote a novel about the relationship with cancer and my wife, who is very, very sad, it's not the main theme but it's my story. So it's an experiment; it's a story about my own life, but I'm also trying to tell something about my husband, but he's not telling it because that's part of how he lives and how they are. It's not his life. It's his relationship with cancer and how it has impacted that relationship. So that takes some work; I'm only doing that because I'm really passionate about telling a story of some sort. I have a lot of fun writing, but I'm not writing for myself. I'm writing for others, so I'm not an amateur. I wrote some books, and at the end of the day, I love other people, and I love my family. But in all fairness, I don't know what can happen with that.So you are an independent writer?Ya, yeah. I think i...
544|In 1991 the world's biggest music festival was held in los angeles, california. It came to an end with the loss of the biggest musical event of the decade, the grammy awards.A lot of things in hollywood and in america are not working out. We are trying to do better than that. We need to start thinking of new ways to do that. Because that's so exciting, and it's very hard to start thinking about things that are not working out. It's been a long time, and we are going to get through that.How much does it take to get to this point?My first major breakthrough was in the 1990s when we finally worked with james mazzucchelli and bob moulde about a collaboration with the late michael corleone called "The last year." It was great to work with him and our producer, michael, and to work with both, john and mike, and to have them say something like, "Look this whole time there were so many great artists here." And that is what happened.I think it was about the same time that the rolling stones turned it into a hit, which is now one million copies sold and we have to sell it. And after that it was about, "Well, why the hell would I want to let you come to this show on a saturday night when there were so many great artists?"The way we've talked about our relationship with michael an...
545|When you were a young boy, a friend of mine decided to take you on a long trip to the jungle when he saw you camping in the jungle. So when I was 13 years old there was a jungle just in front of our house. And then I saw this big tree sticking out from under a tree, like this huge bush with the branches of a dragon. And I got really interested and was like, "Okay, let's get on the ground and get down there." And I was like, "Ooh, ok, so that's a nice looking tree!" And they came down and made some sort of a tree out of it and the two of them started screaming at each other. They even got to keep singing and yelling at each other.A little bit of a joke about it is, when you're 18 or 19 years old you've got a lot to do. And your parents always told you you didn't need to do this to be successful and that you went to college. And I guess you're kind of wrong about that, but it's sorta cool that you know that this kind of thing was all, like, cool to make and not much was ever written about how bad it was, so I'lljust give you some advice. It's funny because I'm just glad that it was the right move because you don't have to remember all these little things like, "Oh, oh, oh, wow! I actually had fun while doin...
546|I was sitting alone at the table with my husband at the beginning. We were having dinner and I just turned the table at him and he was staring at me and said, "What do you think. You know what happens when you sit down? You feel like you're going through a dream-dream and you are like, 'no, I'm not going to go out.'" But the first thing he said was, "You are going to go out of the dream. That's what happens." And he said, "I am going to go in and out of it like this." And I was like, "Okay, it is going to be a different story." And so he kind of took me aside and said, "I did it. I got out of the dream. You know what I told you?" He said, "I told you what you are going to do. You will do this as much as you can just because you're there. And don't ever try to tell me what you are not going to do because you are a total mess."Amy goodman: let's go to the latest in donald trump's business, the trump shuttle.Juan gonzález: well, donald trump does something that is not even remotely like what these businessmen do. But he does something that even the average american businessman, he does things that are extremely important. He does things that are beyond the reach of most of the norma...
547|When in the early 20th century my dad left japan, for the first time ever, the world came to my own. In the 19th and 20th decades I lived in europe.So when I was about 10, my mom passed away. I think one day, as I was finishing up my school career, I was thinking about a good girl that I admired and wanted to learn more about. So I got to know her. So I knew that this was a good person to go with.Then I saw her on social media; I saw her on instagram."She is so kind and loving. She just loves the world. She is so generous and so caring towards people." --katherine l.I really think in our world we don't want to make people miserable. But I am a big fan. So this girl was so gentle and loving. I thought,"I really think this girl is such a good person." --kate l.Because she was so gentle and kind, she didn't worry when I came out of hiding or about who I was; she just cared for me. Because I love her, I loved her too. So that's what I learned.She's so generous and so kind in her attitude, so she makes me feel good. So that's what I learned right from my first lesson. I really really feel like we have to make sure we are open minded abou...
548|I have a boy aged 18 from my town. He was playing a game with his friends when he went up to his friend's house (my local school). We were all at the house in a group of 5, 6 or 7 kids. His friends had all got a game, got out and got it. They had one boy and two girls. He was doing his normal stuff. He had the ball and ran to his friend's house (my local school) and took his ball and ran to his friend's house, where he ran to his friend's house and ran to his friend's house. I know that story, but is it true – it really is? He got out of the game, ran to his friend's house, and ran to his friend's house. I know – I am sure it is true too. There are other schools in the area where players can be involved in any number of different activities. The ones with the greatest potential to engage with other players are those schools. That is why you see such a huge opportunity for the sport to be seen as a way of playing.For the more casual players, there are clubs and clubs for this kind of game that offer to take the players along for the ride. These clubs, which offer all kinds of activities, offer for the players to be at the end of the ride, to be able to go home, to play and have an enjoyable time during a ride.Some clubs and club...
549|you know, the one that was kind of the highlight of our film's success? That she's an amazing voice for me, her voice, and my whole team. She makes everything look exciting, you know, and she makes me want to go for it. And she makes me want to go for it.It took me a couple of years of listening to this show about what it feels like to be a female character in star trek. I've always just sort of been able to relate to the idea that you have to be that character. And she's so smart and so smart and so smart, and I can't imagine if she was going to be on the next generation or any other show or any other show that hadn't been shot with those other characters.So let me start this by saying that I'd be absolutely delighted to be a part of both of those shows, with these huge characters that have been on and off the set for so long. And obviously star trek has been really interesting about this and that.There are plenty of women in this world who have actually been part of the show. There's amy poehler, there's lena dunham and there's lena dunham, and there's tina fey and there's kate mckinnon, and there's john lithgow, and there's the many, many people who have made it to our shows and all of us, and who have seen this show grow from a ver...
550|This is an old man who was in his late 30s and was about to leave his home when he heard a loud voice say, "You're dead!" And the rest of the party got into the car and pulled over so they could leave in the same direction. As they got out of the car they saw the car go out and a car with a gun coming off in front of them. The woman in the car had pulled the trigger and fired one round that struck the car just as it was being pulled up the road and onto the ground. It struck the man in the head, killing him instantly. The man had been shot in his head and that was then the point. We don't know why this happened, but that's one more reason why I want to know what happened to that man. I have a hard time coming up with any sort of explanation for why he wasn't arrested because I have no idea who the person was or where his death was.On friday, the police said that when the victim was shot five days earlier, he had a gun and it was on his head. It was also on the ground. Two days later, the man in the car pulled up in a ditch on the street and he was shot and killed in that ditch.Do you know why the woman in that car pulled down the car and shot the man in the head while he was in that ditch? Because she had no weapon and she didn't want to ge...
551|Our first visit, you might remember from the movie "Falling skies," Took place in the year 1856. We were part of a band that would go on to make the biggest impact on american history. We would spend weeks doing music videos, listening to music that would change the way we watched american history. We would record our thoughts and feelings on the history we lived in.We had a couple of musical adventures, like our first night on the radio. It was a big gig. This was a great idea for my family, and I felt it was the right thing to do. So, on that night, we all decided to go to the stage and play with a group of american bands that had toured the world before. We knew they had some problems with the u.S. Government and the music industry there, so as we went back to the hotel, we were at every door. We came up and we saw how great the music business was. We had already met the beatles, who are the greatest musicians ever. We played "The one," Which was pretty good. Even though the music industry was terrible, the people who were out there were very good. Everybody was just really nice and generous. We really wanted to see how it could be that the music industry would work.There were probably a dozen or more bands at the time. Our first concert was at the grammys, and that was in 1959. The second time was at new yor...
552|When I was 15, a friend of mine and I spent some time in mexico city. He was there with three people who were talking about all sorts of things. As we were going to bed, our friend gave us a cigarette for our sleep and he said, "We just didn't get it. You have to admit that it was a pretty good one and you'll be glad it was." His friend then made an appointment for us to go on a tour. We arrived at a hotel on the other side of town, and within a day or two, it was over. The hotel was empty, and the next day we went to dinner with our friends on the roof of the hotel. It took the next 20 minutes until we were alone for the evening with all the others. I remember thinking how great the experience was, how it was a little over 10 years ago. I don't know why I remember it the way it is now, but I remember it vividly. We all went to dinner with the rest of the friends at the top of the restaurant and I knew it wouldn't be that good. I was so grateful for that experience, but I didn't know the reason that it happened.I remember one night watching another guy play with a friend and he said, "We'll see you in this video. Now, you know, we were not going to get the whole night in here." Well, the next morning we met up with our fellow friends that nigh...
553|It started a fire in my head and then a fire in my wife. And I told her that. And they said, okay. What's the difference? They said she could use a car. And I said, okay. She said, the car was so good. She can do this. She can do that. She can do this. I said, okay."I was not at home when mrs. Obama came home and I said, "Well, let me know if I miss." She said yeah, I miss.I was at the end of our dinner at the end of the day and she said, "Oh, look, there's my family here. She's a big hugger. She's always been here. She's always been good to me. When we're married and we do the same thing, that's the thing. I'm so glad I was home with her."A couple of years ago she said she got married.""Oh right. A couple of years ago she said, well, my husband didn't want to have kids. So I said, well I'm going to give him a little money. Let's just go to school next week so maybe we won't have to look for work."When I asked what the word "Money" Means, she said, "It's money for us, money for our kids, money for our future, whatever it is, just you kno...
554|I met my first girlfriend in college. We lived in a small apartment house, and we had a lovely room. It was about six or seven feet high. So I knew she was beautiful, and the door was open, and she opened it and said, "Mom. I've got a little boy, so I'm going to take him to the hospital." The doctor said, "I'm going to give you a big round injection to the face." I said, "I'll do this!"He went into the room and started getting in to you. He started talking to you. And I was very surprised when I heard him talk to you. I didn't know who he was. But I did know that he had been drinking recently and I knew he drank to help. She wasn't able to get him out. I asked her, "Dad, who are you?" And he was talking to her about his new boyfriend. How could he be trying to get out of this situation? How could he be trying to get out of being in the hospital? That is what I was thinking. I have to explain to you why I don't believe in people, because you have to explain to me to believe in this. I mean, what do you want me to believe in?We have to figure out a way to tell these stories. And I know you are going to tell me about all of these different possibilities, and one of the ways I will d...
555|the first time I heard about your company, I was on the phone to my father when we were kids. We were very into a lot of things. He had a friend and we were really into music, and he played guitar. All of a sudden, in order to get into my band or what he was doing, he told me I wouldn't be doing a record until after my son was 15. I said, "Yeah, but if it's a record, I'lldo it." I never saw that kid again. As soon as I got that letter, I knew I had to do it.So I was at a gig, and at that point, I thought, "Oh, wow. So, I'm just gonna make this record on my own." When you're working with your band, you probably feel the need to show someone. But how do you find your place with your band?It's so much more than just the songs you're writing. It's so much more important to me. And that's why i've been doing this for so long.What's your favorite thing about working with your peers?I think it's so much more interesting if I'm working with people in a good light. I mean, it's so great to know that people are listening to you and being really funny with your lyrics. It's even more interesting when you have your parents singing to you that way, too...
556|I love it when people who know me say to each other, 'this is the man who once took your hand. He was his self,' so I guess I'm always asking him 'what did you do that other day?' This is who I am.That's not the only thing I miss about my parents. Sometimes I don't even know where to start.They moved out of the house that summer. They moved on. I've always thought they were moving out of the house, but I never really wanted to, because I didn't want them to become neighbors. They were moving to another house where I spent a lot of time with my dad and my sister. I had to do that because my dad would never let me stay with my sister. He's a good friend of mine, but he didn't help me with my homework and things like that. So I think it just kind of came from his heart, but it's not like he ever gave me time to think about it. When I think about it, I know that I really wanted to be in this house, but that's not what I wanted because I didn't want to be around my sister. I'm not a big fan of having my father in another house when I can be in the same place.It was really hard to move out of the house because I knew I had to stay with my dad, because I wasn't going to be able to talk to anyone i...
557|my father was a very good sportsman. He worked in the football game and played there for four years. I am talking my whole life. I grew up in a farm community that had a lot to offer, one of the best family farms in the state. When I was a kid I moved to san diego and got into film school. I made up a bunch of games a year and got into film school in san diego, just like my dad. It was then, that I really noticed some things and went to san diego for my first film school. I got to meet the amazing teachers, directors, and actors that I wanted to see. I met a bunch of other great people that went to film schools for the first time as well.For our first film school, our first day in san diego I was in the gym at 6:30, sitting back and trying to figure out how not to get tired. My coach would say, "It's ok, you work hard here." My first day here was much better for me than the first day I went to san diego. I had a big workout in bed before the start of the game, and I was running like crazy. I didn't feel like I was a burden when I walked to the locker room and started to set fire to everything.I went for an 8:30 p.M. Practice with my teammates. After practice I went over for a meal and they came to m...
558|I'm the ceo of this company, and I'm the guy who founded this company. I know that some of you may be confused at the idea, but my company is one of those companies that I'llcall "A company you can count on for years." There are a lot of people, there are a lot of folks who are here, and then there are a lot of people who don't work here.I started the company. When I was 13 or 14, my dad came from the philippines. He had a big car. He had a big desk. I remember his first wife came up to me and said that there must be some kind of relationship in the family, and so I started this company.We got started in 2003. A few years later, somebody who was a manager at the company decided that he would help make money for the company by donating. I asked for the money and they agreed. In fact, we went in to the ceo, and we gave him $2,500. We have had a lot of good people doing this.So, at that point, I was sitting there in the company office and I watched this crazy guy with a big desk, and he was in the process of getting the $2,500 for his own company, which was what I called it.He had a huge desk as the ceo. He was kind of, like, "Ok, what's this? We're goin...
559|I was a little kid—i got a job at my college in tennessee. I worked at a factory, and I couldn't get a decent job. I had to work a lot. So I walked into a place called the "Titanium factory," And I took out my cellphone, my wallet, and my credit card numbers so I could take notes on my bills. And I was like, "Yo, don't do this job. But here's another kind of job."Amy goodman: this is democracy now!, democracynow.Org, the war and peace report. I'm amy goodman. I'm amy goodman. Welcome to democracy now! Amy goodman, welcome again to democracy now! Can you just say a few things about this?Amy goodman: you're right. Yeah, a story that's been told for a long time now, but in a moment of great national political significance. Here is an interview from the national review that you were quoted saying about an event the next day at the white house that was supposed to represent, if not transform, the country. You talked about one of the things that a lot of people in this country are doing is running for office.Robert siegel: I'm not sure if it's true, because i've never actually seen anything like it. But if it's true, I'lltell you this: the national review was, you know, a conservative publication, and they put u...
560|I know I'm a girl. And the man I like in my life, this handsome, soft-spoken man with a beautiful body and a beautiful wife and two adorable little boys, he's always been my favorite girl in the house. And I'd rather be with him than have been with him.It wasn't as though any woman could say so publicly about how she felt about the man who was his lover. Or, as she phrased it, "I think there's a lot of blame on him," For their relationship ended. For the record, while this relationship was not always so successful, it had always been the best. It has been this way ever since she was growing up, when she was taught how to use the language of her own life. She went from being a very successful writer to a very successful actress in her life – in her career, in her movies, in her commercials – and she went and got paid, and went to new york to do tv shows.I don't blame women in any way. It had to do with how it was she who was taking it on the stage, which in my mind was her life – her life in a world where most people were not prepared for it.I did not know that there was a line or two that I wanted to cut straight after the couple of years I'd left my husband. But even that doesn't mean it was a bad thing. I wanted to cut i...
561|Our home was a beautiful white house with a beautiful garden."That's a pretty good story, but I'm no gardener. I'm a real gardener. A gardener who uses all manner of tools. But if I want to find the best way to make you happy, I will have to think carefully about these tools.What was your first discovery?I went to a couple of friends' houses in connecticut. They were just about the only people I wanted to meet. And I went from being a middle aged man and a small farmer to being a farmer.And I found a bunch of garden tools and started taking them to the local yard.So you got to find a way to make your garden happy without leaving your house?I came across a lot of tools I didn't really know about. And sometimes you can't be that excited to be in a treehouse. And I went out of my way to help make sure I knew where I was standing.What was your first experience of a gardener when you were in your twenties?We're two years apart in age. And now I really feel different. My arms are now more extended. And my hands are longer. And I'm getting used to it.How did you come about to become a gardener?I started to look for ways to make it better. I started to do experiments, in that I wen...
562|i was with my friend when somebody came into the house, grabbed him hand and head and said "I'm a lawyer. How much money do they owe me?" I said, "They didn't need to put it there. They just wanted to make sure they paid the debts." And he said, "You're going to have to take care of the house. We need your money." And I said, "Really?" "Well, we don't need anybody." And he said, "Well, the money for the house is coming." And I said, "Wait a minute. Where was i?" He said, "It's in your name, buddy." And I said, "I'm just talking to you because you should be able to be with someone's parents when they're sick or dead."And I said, "It's true. I've been with my mom and my brother and my sister in the military and i've been with them. They've been with us. I've been in a lot of situations. They didn't have to put things there just to make sure they paid the debts." I said, "Sure. Why not?" And he said, "It's because they're sick in a military hospital. They've been with us. They're sick in some places." We are a family of love. We have the benefit of knowing those people, and we have a lot of compassion in dealing with them.Th...
563|A woman from a far-off land with nowhere to hide found herself in a strange place. The story starts out small, with a man and a woman walking through the open desert. But as the men grow distant from her, they begin yelling, screaming at her. They take her with them for a few minutes, and then they come back and they start screaming again, like in a mad game: "Where can you help?!?" It's a weird moment when we're about to get into it, because this woman has been living in the woods and suddenly has a whole different world.Then she hears an alarm. It's a strange scream she hears, but she's too quiet and the sound she hears is quite loud. And then she hears another scream and another sound of panic. And she starts to run, and then one of the men starts screaming again, this time with a shotgun. The male is screaming, and so is the woman, and at the same time the sound of a shell casing and fragments of the woman's face, or of the man's hands on his face, or of her body. And then everyone is screaming, and the woman starts to cry and run, and she runs, and eventually the men start running from the women; and then the women start yelling, and then they are chasing after them and the men run at them. People start running to her. There's a screaming woman everywhere; there is a screaming man everywhere; and the...

565|I was trying to tell an average story, like an actor saying, 'oh, he made an amazing movie and I want to make sure we're seeing it on screen,' and they would come and get to the theater, and I said, 'please, we'll need to come back.' They would come back, and I would go home, and I would go through the film theater for a while, and then they would come back. So now, I can tell the story, but I will tell it for the sake of your money and that's for the next person I'm going to pay you, because that's for everybody," She said...
566|Every day you get to look at his photos, and your eyes look forward to these shots in the future.I remember the first time I saw him while working for this agency, when I was 16 years old. He worked for a company called giorgio echeverria and he was always with us, doing all kinds of projects. He was from italy, I was 15, I was 23 years old, when he first moved in to the country. He would do the same thing, doing all kinds of crazy stuff, like the old pictures. He had a camera and a camera that he loved. He was an amazing person, and he was very special in that way because if you look back on all of his work, you will see that he was very talented.When you were a kid you'd always be a student. There were kids, but it was a little bit of a shock to see him on a regular basis, and that changed a great deal.We always had a very strong association that we built ourselves. We were never afraid of being labeled a kid or something, we were always very strong, and we always had a good relationship with his family, but you know, he was never just a kid. He had a very good family, too, and he had a very nice mother, too. And then he was very ambitious, and he was trying to be that, even if you didn't know what he was going t...
567|I have always had this idea, and this was the first time I ever came into contact with the idea that the government had been looking at my health," She said. "In the early nineteen-seventies they were looking for the person who was going to get into the hospital for cancer because they needed a surgeon for that reason. So that was the person I got."The woman worked for a government agency before moving to the united states, though, and she had a good relationship with her husband. "It was a nice friendship, the same way you'd get the girlfriend of a great friend," Said ms. Hurd. "But there was one thing that wasn't very close to anybody else that he really had respect for. His family didn't seem to approve of him. He had an unkindness toward the rest of the family. So he had this horrible, unkindness toward them. He really got an unkindness towards the rest of the family by doing those things that really seemed bad."Ms. Hurd said that she was also raised as a catholic, the way she was raised. When she did graduate school, she read the catholic experience by john h. H. Reynolds in the yearbooks of the boston medical school. She became interested in catholicism for two reasons: first, she saw it as a way to get out of the traditional ways of seeing the world and to change things. She saw catholic education as an opportunity. He...
568|When I was in elementary school, my principal, one of my teachers, was having a difficult time and told me that if I would only take a few more minutes to read the book, my school students would be in a better place. My teacher, I assume, just didn't believe me.A couple weeks ago I heard news that the federal bureau of investigation would not take over the national security of the american police force. I was not allowed to read or speak on the matter. I had my freedom and my civil liberties suspended immediately. I was even asked to leave the national guard and moved out of town.I was told that the police force would not be going to a place like this. I was told I was just 'not going to believe anything you say.'I went to the fbi and was told that if I had lied about what I was doing and why I was being asked to leave the fbi or go to the united states. That was immediately followed by a complete and total blackout in my ability to walk off the fbi property. I was also told that every time I tried to walk off the fbi property I would face a criminal prosecution for violating the fourth amendment. I had never been caught doing that. All of this was absolutely and very true.I didn't know how I would be punished if I said my story about being in a car accident in the summer of 2014 was true.I was in the classroom at firs...
569|First of all, I knew we were going to get this story, but I could never believe that they couldn't just come out with this. They didn't even do a story that was completely factual or completely accurate. And we were in la, so there was a whole bunch of people who had been working on the show and all were saying that they came to the show to do a piece that was different from anything they'd ever seen before, and it was absolutely different. And it was hilarious and a little bit funny. And it was like, "Oh my gosh, I think this is going to get really funny."And you know, because I was working on [breaking bad]. I remember talking to one of the writers, and she said, "I'm going to come in and we're going to put 'breaking bad'" On your show, and I was like, "No, I'm gonna write something, and you'll want to do it." That's how I got my writing credit in the middle of the episode.And then, you know, because the thing is, in terms of the story of the show, and how the characters are, the people are, and what they're doing. As you said, it was like just trying to be funny and funny and funny and funny. It was really like, if we were able to have this all in one place – there was a lot of fun and some really interesting stuff that w...
570|In my case, it was a story of one friend who made the decision to start my marriage and to have children from that relationship. He was 19 years old when he had met the lady of his dreams.We sat in his living room with all of us looking at the wall of the room with the same smile on our faces. He looked like a child. He had no idea about that girl who was in the room. He didn't think about it. He was too old for the situation. But the girl looked and felt pretty. She came up and asked him if he wanted to go to some school and she told him that it was a great chance to do so. I knew something was up but I wasn't sure. I thought about how young the girl is growing up. But then I heard a long, deep cry, "Noh! What would happen if I was a grown woman and didn't go to any school?" A very familiar voice went up and said, "You know, I love you."As we walked down the hall, I said, "You're still there? You know what I'm telling you, don't you worry about it, I want to find somebody else to have these children with, a husband and a wife who will make a decent life for my family. That would be a life he could live happily ever after. But I can't stay there forever. I can't take it."I didn'...
571|I was a teenager, I was born in 1947 at one of the worst times in my life. I was 16 when I was kidnapped by a mob and forced to give birth. I was 14 on the day when I was attacked and attacked by a mob. I was 17. My mom asked me about it. "How do you deal with a mob that beats up girls?" And I said if I was a girl, I was a girl. She told me that if you had a girl, you don't have to go to the police and deal with it. She didn't even know about the whole issue. If you look at the reports it's not like a thing. In fact, I was in the police station, and I said "Okay, I'm going to go with you." It was an illegal operation. I was the most frightened and scared. On the way to the police station I was stopped by a young man for saying something in spanish and I just said something to him. I said, "What are you doing?" He said "I am being beaten up." So I said, "You mean my head is getting cut off for this?" It was quite shocking but at the time most people were not aware of what was happening. But they came to see what was going on, and they came to see what happened. And the situation was horrible and horrible. I never went to the police, where I had been a prosecutor, but I got arrested at th...
572|I was a little kid in my mid-30's, the one thing you always wanted to do with your life, wasn't to start a business, right? I wanted my family to know I wasn't just going to leave it at that. My mom's going to tell you that I don't want those things to be true, that I'm not just going to sell this thing to people. That life's real. And the world has changed.It's been so long since i've started something. So many times I'm thinking, 'why would I want to be a lawyer and just have kids and not feel any passion for that thing that I love to do?' I'm trying to be that person. But you know what? My mother is a very good lawyer. But she's got a lot of work to do, so I really have to do a full-time job to make sure she's good at it.I just feel like, I kind of feel like I can be successful. But my mom has to do it in her own way, so that's going to take care of me, right?We work together very hard.In terms of your relationship with your father, it feels very much like a continuation of everything you've been through.Yeah. He's been through so much. He's been through so much. And I wish him the best and hope he works hard at his job...
573|One of the great discoveries of the last few decades in american politics was the discovery that so much information is available to everyone about the workings of the big corporations. This has given us a new kind of information, a new kind of understanding of who really is on their side and who are going to win elections against them. And we know that we are in a moment where it is actually time for those political forces to put their political hands in front of the media.So let us do that by talking a little bit more about what are the big issues of our time right now. First of all, how big is the government? How big are we talking about the health of our nation, and how do we build the infrastructure to actually deal with the future, that is this big government we can just walk under. There are four pillars that are built in the united states government: the executive branch, the legislative branch, the judiciary, and the military. These two branches, the executive and the legislative, are different. Each branch is built around a certain goal: to accomplish what the executive is seeking to accomplish. This is a very specific, very specific goal, and we should recognize that. And that is what's going on right now, because, first of all, that it is very, very costly for congress to legislate, and for the president to legislate and to govern, and to go into the senate and to go into the house to work with the president. An...
574|I have never liked to see people who have a good view of the world. But I do want to say something about the way we treat women that is very different than the way we treat men.The problem with using the word "Women" With respect to women is that you get so involved in your work that one of the first things that comes to your mind is "They're not that important." You get so involved in the work that a lot of them want to leave work because you can't get in a room with them.That's exactly what happens when you look at the stories that you're sending out, especially these kind of stories about the women who are leaving work because there have been problems with things like this. But if you have a bunch of stories and it's because they're from women, you tend to get a little bit of a shrug when that happens. But if a lot of them are from men — and that's not what I have experienced, I don't mean that in a bad way. I've had one man tell me that he felt like he needed a woman to help him get his car out. He said, "No, I love my husband. I just can't get in here to get my car out. I don't even like to see my husband driving around in his pants pants anymore."And that's not something that I think you ever want to hear about.People have been so dismissive o...
575|I was at a job fair last fall when I got a call on one of the most popular radio shows in town, one that was on wcbs and it was about the american civil liberties union. I said, "Let's talk about the aclu. I want to hear from you about the case of the transgender person who is now considered a national symbol of hate crimes." The reporter who was standing next to me, who I'm sure had no idea I was doing this, asked me to come up to him and get to know him. I said, "I'm from alabama, and I'm from alabama." I said, "You're from alabama?" He said, "What time is it?" I said, "I'm gonna ask you later." He said, "Well, I'm from alabama. I'm from a state you can call alabama and then you have to call me on the phone. That'll fix it." I said, "Ok, go ahead." He said, "Ok." Then I was told it was a federal case. No, this one is a federal case and alabama was not the appropriate place to be trying."Gail: I have no idea why you are talking about that.Jensen: no.Gail: you are saying that it has been a federal case. Do you feel there is some difference between alabama, where she was born and where you are?Jensen: no...
576|if someone on a national security advisory panel asked you to do some real business, you probably won't be asking them. You might not want to.

But you won't just be doing what you want to do.

577|My mother died when I was in middle school aged ten, my father died when I was five. It became clear to me that we were not going to survive long. I felt that we had to figure out how to live as well as we could. I felt the pressure. I felt like I was having to make sacrifices. What do I mean? I felt like they were going to destroy me. I remember that it was really early in my adolescence when my teacher called me. 'What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm not being a hero. Let's look at that face. We're not the same, we are different.' She said that I'd have to take a little step back, because I didn't know what to do next.He would be so embarrassed, but he took this as an invitation and said, 'you know what, go do it. It's going to cost your life.' I did it. I told him, 'i am not going to kill you, I have to keep going with you.' I went to a friend's house, where I found a big stick of bone and a little bit of a stone, because I knew there was something wrong in my house. I was very nervous. I was so afraid of it, just like many other people. I just thought we were going to have to fight these demons.I went to see my first psychiatrist for the first time. He said that it wa...
578|In my first week at university, I was a junior at an english-speaking university in london, and I was sitting in a small meeting room discussing the future of london. A group of young english-speaking students were sitting in the back and they were chatting about economics and the future of the country. And one of them came up to me, who had a big smile on her face.I was sitting down with a group of five or six guys. They were all pretty much from the back. In the back was an english-speaking guy: a little kid who didn't think much about economics. I saw this kid, and started walking towards him. I felt pretty strongly about my decision. For sure, I liked economics, I never had a problem with that stuff. But at the time I knew that if I went to work as an academic, or as an economist, I'd have to study something different. I thought, "Oh, right, I'm so sure I'm going to make it, that's so stupid."Then one of them came up to me and said, "You're young. Why did you come to us?" I said, "I wanted to learn about business. I didn't want any financial background at all." I had a degree in engineering from cambridge, and I had no interest in economics, so I made it my dream to become an economist.I told them, "How did you know about economics?...
579|I went on a trip to africa with my father. We went and bought the most expensive car in the world, the audi a6. I'm from germany with three children. And I thought, 'wow, this car is worth 10 times that.' And so I left everything and ran into the country, then to africa with an ex-husband.You know what you do with it. There are so many amazing people from all over the world. And I think we all share in that passion for making a car. It's a passion that we all share in our hearts. Every family will love a car, and that makes it special to me. My own dad is an incredible man so he's always been trying to make the most incredible cars. So, it was amazing on a sunday. It was an amazing opportunity. I've been in the car business for 11 years now.How long did you work with the ford and mazda teams?I didn't work the first couple years with the ford. And I don't know how long it lasted, but I did work on the first two teams. I worked with bob stumpf and frank ruggiano. So we worked on the last two teams. I think I still work the last two teams with bob ruggiano, but I think we didn't work hard. I know that frank is very passionate about his car business, and frank and I had a lot of work to do to ge...

She is so sweet and I love her.I am so happy, happy and grateful if you were there.I love you.So thank you for going out with me on this trip. I hope you had a great trip.I love you and I love you, too, thank you for making me what I am.

582|When I was at home, my grandfather was working in the textile industry. We got a job as housekeepers. We had one job; and that was it — one that, like everyone else, I would be paid, and we would get some rest. When I was 17, I went down to chicago and I went, and I didn't have my lunch on the table. When I was 23, I went to california and went to school and got to work at a big bank. And then when I was 21, I went to new york to live in new york; I didn't have my breakfast on the table. I was in the hospital in may of '76. Now, when I got through it, I didn't have my lunch on the table. I had my lunch on the table. And then I got my pay back. I didn't have my lunch on the table. I didn't have my lunch, on that day. I didn't need to take my lunch off the table.Amy goodman: now, there were some very courageous people on the street right up there. When you came to chicago to work, these young men came up and said they would help get your back on the street. They had to do this; but I'm sure in your own life some young man would say, "You have got work to do, but you don't have to take your lunch off the floor." No, I don't think you can...
583|On christmas day I was watching a movie with my brother and I saw some really interesting things because we were playing a game of chess on the couch. My brother came over to us and he was really excited about something and said, "Well, my brother's chess game is going to be really interesting." I said, "Wait, what does that mean?" He said, "What exactly?" I said, "It means that he's going to be able to create something different with this game in his living room, which i've been playing since the last game I played." My brother said, "No, you don't need to play that, it's a game." I said, "Wait, I'm doing it all right, how do I play it?" My brother said, "It's a completely different game, but it doesn't make any sense to me." It was a game that was a very different game. It felt strange, and then, again, he wasn't a very good player at the time! He had developed a lot of problems with that new player. I knew that when one of my cousins came over to me to play that game that I thought, "This is so much better." And I just kind of told him, "Well, i've been playing it for about a year now. I am going to play it really well because it feels very different than when I first tried it." And I played it for a long time. I'...
584|You have just been diagnosed with als, and you have had very serious brain damage with it, so you have been on a plane for six months and the doctor told you he was going to look into your blood. He wanted to see whether you were on a ventilator. He tried to see if you wanted to go to the surgery room. But all he could see was the blood pouring out his nose. And from that point on you were not going to be able to walk."Dr. Lutzen says people with als get a lot of trouble getting back into work because of their seizures."So this is the problem," Lutzen says. "And if you don't have a job, you're not going to get to work, so you are going to get a lot of work that is too little, too late for you."Lutzen, along with his colleagues, have been taking steps to help others get off work so they can continue working.This year, a partnership he founded began to distribute als medications to workers at several large retail stores in the city. The national association of manufacturers, a group of auto dealers responsible for manufacturing in the u.S., also gave the company access to doctors who can help pay for recovery."I'm in a room full of people who're going through a lot of pain and suffering and they want to get off it," Lutzen says...
585|Two young women in the area went to see my company work together to learn about the state-of-the-art solar panel manufacturing process. One of the women said, 'i don't know what you're talking about? There is a lot of good information around that and it's nice to know about it,' and she went on to say, 'the next time you think about doing some solar power or doing other things with solar energy, do think about the state of the art. The solar power industry is an incredibly competitive industry. There are a lot more people in that space than there are people in any other market.'"At that point, I made the decision to ask the woman in question what she thought of the next step of her company's evolution in bringing on the woman who'd just graduated. "Oh, sure," She said, "I think I do. Yes, that is my answer to that question. I know it's always been our focus, from the start. The last year we've brought on female engineers and architects. I just don't understand why the whole industry would be so hostile to female employees. It's not about me, the world, but about the way we see these women's work. It's about the way they are getting the job done and what their career goals are. If there are some good people out there who don't like it all they can do is work on it. If you see them do something different or wan...
586|i was a teenager when I was first introduced to the science of evolution. One of my classmates, who I was in high school with, came up to me and asked how I could know about evolution for the scientific community. I told him that I thought science is all about evolution, and then he asked me what the definition would be of it. I would think, "It's about evolution," And then he would ask, "How do you know?" And I would reply, "Well, evolution is about the behavior of the species. It's about the evolution of plants and animals. And evolution is about how to make people. It is about what is true about nature. And that's what the science is about." And he was a great believer that we should believe in the things that nature said about us, and believe in what nature said about this world.And you can only ask the same questions of those who are studying the evolutionary sciences in their homes. They are still studying biology, biology in nature. So I have always felt that science should be taught by homeschoolers and homeschooling parents.Question: and I'm going to pause here and just let you ask, you know, how do you know the answer to this question?Bill moyers: first of all, i've already told you it's not a scientific question, it's not a psychological question, it's not a scientific test. And that'...
587|We were sitting down at our kitchen table with our family back home in kansas city, missouri. Our four lovely girls and I had been invited to a bar event, when we were all at the same time. We were all in a different room and we didn't know each other, which is really nice. So we went out and I was in the kitchen, and we went to go out with my brother, and he was telling us about the restaurant, where they were, and he said he was staying there with me and we had a party, and there was a huge crowd of people there who seemed very nice. I remember being like, 'oh my god, what a great party. Oh my god, this must be amazing.' And that's when I remember thinking, 'there must be this, this must be a party, this must be fun."So he said, "Well, we were all in the same room, and this is what it was, and I was with a friend of mine and he was talking to us and she said, "The restaurant is on the same floor, so let's go, or we can go ahead and go to a different venue and let's just do it together. Let's go and see what happens. We'll just bring our drinks, and it's our first party since we moved out."So we did. And then we went and we just said, "The next party is on the same floor...
588|when we were doing the game, we had to make sure something really good was happening. We were trying to do so much, right?But then I started doing some gameplay, and you want to do a good thing and take a good look at what's going on inside. You can see we were really pushing back. But we had to push back a lot because this is a game with many worlds and there weren't many ways around it. This is a game that was made out of a lot of material, and some of that was the music. So we started with some music and took a lot of time to do this.I went through the art and art direction and there were many things. There's too many things, too many people. It's hard and it's going to take a long time. I was working with an artist for many years and we were having to do some art because we couldn't do a great thing for it.What is it like writing your voice for the game?We're both actors. We're always playing roles in our own games and I think that's part of the reason why we're so good at music. I'm playing a character that's going to do the same job. I love to play the drums and the bass and sometimes some of the beats.We play different parts of the game than people. We're both writing songs.So you're probably doin...
589|A girl named chloe came by in the middle of the night when she was walking home from school.She was wearing a top that had a nice little skirt, but she was wearing a dress.She said, "I love you chloe!"Chloe said, "Yes? Yes, I love you.I love you too chloe."And then as chloe got up from the bed, they were on the floor, staring at each other.There was a brief moment after, and chloe looked up at her. "You're not here for me? Don't you hear?""No!" The girl said."I'm okay," Chloe replied.She ran her fingers through her hair, reaching for the back of the dress to keep it down. "Oh yeah?"She looked up at chloe. She reached down once, and pulled that back. "Don't you want to be alone? I mean, you do. Not even in school, aren't you?""Yes, yes chloe," Chloe said."I'm not going to pretend to not be here because of you, I'm not. I can't be here for you either," Chloe said.Chloe got up and put her hands on the back of her neck, putting the back of her dress back in place. "But I don't want to go away at all. I want someon...
590|A lot of things happened. There was a fire that started and I don't know what happened, but it was an extremely heavy fire that exploded a few times, and the fire went by the name of 'vladimir.' And then I was taken down a little bit by the fire and it took all my clothes off and turned into a very big hole and I fell down on the floor. It took the clothes off, and my clothes were taken off, and I'm kind of the only one left. And at that point, I was very sorry about it.Now, obviously, when I was very poor, I was very poor. But it was the very first thing. I knew what was going on at the time. And everybody was thinking, "I don't want to get to vlad and I don't want to get to you." But I didn't want to get to you, so I took off my clothes, and now, when I'm in my twenties or thirties, it's just like, "Oh, look!" And it's like, "Oh, this is so cool!"I've had people tell me to go to the airport. I'm like, "Hey, I'm in russia, it's all so cool!" And it's the airport is very crowded. So, you know, I'm like, "I'm in russia, it's all so cool." And I'm like, "Oh, I wa...
591|The last time you woke up you could tell I was going to be the face of your life. What came next? Did you realize it was a long time ago, a week ago? And why did you think I'd come here to get you and me? The last thing I wanted to do was to fall in love like I'm going to die. I wanted to be the face of my life. We both knew that we had to stay true. The only way to do that was to do it right. And I was right. It was not so much that I had no right, but that I had a right to love you and to love you that much more.And of course, you were right.I didn't leave your apartment. I wasn't a stranger. I don't know why I left you, but I knew that I had to leave you when the right time came. That I had to leave you, because I knew you would not let go of this, that I'd never forget. That I'd never let go of you.It's not what you look like. You're not like the people I knew you to be. Maybe you were the perfect boy you were, but you don't look like the people you're supposed to look like anymore. You're not the person I wanted you to be. Your real name is not on this album.I feel like I'm falling through the cracks of all thi...
592|I was sitting in my house, and one of my brothers and I was in his room in his room, and when one of the brothers woke up, he said, 'i never slept with a man before,'" He recalled. "It broke it off." The brothers started to cry. "That's when I realized that my dad had been telling me every single lie," He recalled.In the meantime, the boys had been playing at a soccer club and their mothers hadn't been with them for several months. The boys and their moms had been at home all week because they were in the process of getting married."I was worried my boys would think I was acting weird," He said. He got a text from his mom saying, "This whole time, I'm watching your father get away from her," And he was getting a message from his brother.The message was that if I called the police, I had no right to know where I was.In other cases such as these, the police would take a look and say something about the suspect."It's hard enough at times," Said robert dominguez, a civil rights attorney at the university of california, berkeley. "I don't think anybody's been prosecuted by the police for what happened to my dad."The police say the call came in from a woman who said she was in the basement bedroom of a north berkeley home. She didn't tell he...
593|i got into real estate. My husband got out of school, I went to an abortion. I took two jobs before I ever took any other job because I had to pay for myself and my kids.I came out of the abortion business, and I went with a different kind of idea:i want to give back to the people who have helped to pay for my own children.I didn't do that because there has been some negative impact on me in different ways in the past. But it makes me think about it more as a person.I wanted to take a different position every day, and I did. I wanted to do it so that my children never have to struggle. It has been an amazing experience to be able to have the support of the families who have helped me pay my mortgage. There are still people who can't make it through the process. Just like when you go back out to the grocery store and you see a bag of flour that says, "Just give me that," Just because you've put it in a bag doesn't mean you can't make it again.I still have this feeling when I walk into my office, and it's like, "I took 20 years to get through it. I just want to take it back for what it was."The story of how I made my decision to become a parent and do this is important. Sometimes when we talk about getting married an...
594|On the day I was told they were going to kill me, I had to make a long journey back to my home and my family. So that was the day when I went back to my home. They left me there on a blackboard, which was the last thing the police did. They put handcuffs on me and took me to a place where they took my money. They put my things in the back of my car. And then, at that moment, people called me a racist. I have no idea what it is. My mother came through the door of my house and called when I got home. I'm not talking to her. I haven't come out of my house. That was just for the facts. So when my father called and said he would be coming and I would be there, I came out. I knew they wanted me there; I knew they wanted me because I did everything right. They had no idea how to fix the problem. I don't know how they got what they were doing. I think it was some young person who got really upset because they were trying to figure out how to get me. And I couldn't believe it, because it sounded quite unbelievable to me. And then, when this young person told me they were going around, I looked at his face and thought "Oh my god, I'm crazy. I'm scared of them." In a way they were just trying to get me out of my home. And I wa...
595|i had an interesting conversation with my sister about the importance of the book.She asked if I had read it. She looked up "Wizard", and said "The secret war", and then I read "It's a good book, don't you think?"I didn't understand. I didn't want to read "It". "It's a good book, don't you think?" I had to learn it from my parents.There were so many lessons learned, and there were so many important lessons learned on the pages, and the pages were very good.You might think, "Oh, they're all too good. We're still learning, and everything is very different." I would have a very bad feeling.So, after spending a few more hours reading, I decided to write a summary of the book.I got this response from my sister.She said, "Don't think that we're writing a book about magic, you know, but it's worth it." She told me to keep playing with the same rules, as she always does, but she wants this piece to be as unique as possible."We're still learning, and nothing is as special as what we did 10 years ago. I hope you understand."The story of how this book came to be is a story from a different era. A very different time.My parents used to sa...
596|I don't know who did it. I don't know if it was a group of young women, some older, some younger, all of them on their way to work, and I know they weren't doing any job, there's no evidence that it was illegal.It's absolutely absolutely true, if you look at a variety of countries. In the united states and most of the countries you look at, people go back to the early industrial revolution, they went into the fields, their children became educated. There's this myth that, 'oh you know, the good things about the world are because of this fact and we all have a good reason to be so thankful for it' or 'because we've got the wealth in this country.'But the reality is that in the united states, over time, over time, even as an economy, the economy began to get poorer, they just started to lose the benefits and the market started to lose the benefits. So the system got so bad that it just stopped working and it just started to work again. They would have to be paid as much as it could be for an hour to get to the supermarket, if you had to pay for the taxi. It was just horrible.So even though the fact that one in four americans lives in poverty is a lot worse than any other situation, the fact that more and more people are getting jobs, is worse than any other situation.Amy goodman...
597|In the late 1970s, two men with a great deal of wealth entered the soviet union. One was a member of the politburo of the ussr and another a member of the politburo of the united states. All had to do was ask permission from the united states to go to the united states embassy in moscow, visit the soviet embassies in moscow, or write a letter asking for permission to travel to the united states. One of those who did so was an american who came to the united states in 1967 with his wife and their children. He became their interpreter and translator. It didn't cost too much, but he did have to pay taxes on the dollars he took from them for the trip. The other, who had a good paying job with the united states embassy in moscow, was given a permit to go to the united states embassy in moscow on the spot, because they had the same status. The visa had to go through an american immigration officer, who would ask him if he wanted to stay in the united states, to say yes. We had our translator. We had our interpreter with us.In 1976, the united states government began to investigate the illegal emigration of soviet immigrants to the united states. President reagan appointed a special investigator, who examined all possible ways in which the emigration of soviet immigrants to the united states was allowed. He concluded that the emigrants were to be treated as non-citizens. The special investigator would have to examine all case...
598|I live in boston and i've been living in north philly for about two of my two years. We lived in a house for several years. I grew up there, and I think, in general, the neighborhood is pretty good. I don't have that sort of experience here, but it is the norm of living here.I had this house here, right out of high school. It was called the home of a friend who was there when it got down to the basement. It had been built from the ground up like a very large home.I guess when you're playing in new orleans, you always have the question of living in an old mansion, but it really wasn't so. The old houses had a big yard, they had a lot of landscaping, and the people's cars were all out there the whole time. It was pretty nice, to be honest.And the house that you did live in, they used to make a large amount of money from that, and we had the house and we put it up for sale, and they did it on a whim. So they put it down for sale for, like, $1.4 million, and I was so glad. It was really nice in an old mansion, but I felt like the house was really nice for the money, and I loved it so much.After some conversations and looking at the history of the house, there were some changes that you didn'...
599|it is on an old bridge.It is one of the few remaining bridges, with three separate sections that span the span of the bridge. Three different bridges, two of them of different colours. But what is this bridge?Yes, it is the bridge of a family in the town of rovaniemi, a small town in russia's far east. It is the main street of rovaniemi, the town that holds the place of pilgrimage for so many russian orthodox jews.At last time it is possible to understand how they came to rovaniemi, for rovaniemi is the only part of russia that is not part of the far east. Because of that its name, the town that houses the synagogue of the patriarch of krasnoyarsk, was named after him, a man who is venerated as a god among russians.But if you look at rovaniemi itself, there are no roads leading to it. If you take a very short road, it is a very long one. But if you take a very long road to the bridge of rovaniemi, you get a very short one, a very long one. The bridge is very short, so you need to pay a lot for it. In other words if you take a very long road to the bridge of rovaniemi, you get a very long one. And then you can buy a lot of cars whic...
600|I was in a car with a friend who was looking for a new car. I pulled up to him and he told me to call him, like he should know that he needs his new car, and we were going to have some fun. We stopped in front of the same door he just said, "Hey, I need a new car." The car he had just had pulled up had a different body color. I asked the question, "What is your favorite car?" And he said, "My favorite car is the lexus." So, he kept doing that. My friend, who was with me at the time, was driving in the same car. He pulled up. The car came to a certain stop sign. I asked him, "What does the lexus look like?" He said it was a convertible-inspired, "Classic." So my friend's mom was really, really looking at it. She asked me, "Is that something you're looking for?" I said, "No, I don't." This is a pretty typical day-to-day experience, and I was excited.J.J.: I was in the passenger seat with the girl, and my dad said, "You know what? I really would like to go with you." And I said, "We don't have the money." He said, "Well, we should come to get you." And I'm like, "Well, I'llgo with mom....
601|I was on my way to the train. I had to get off the train to get in, but in the end, I managed to make it without stopping. Not only were the passengers nice and generous, but I managed to go on. I felt like I just got hit.I've been on my way to train for over 30 years now. If i've ever done anything wrong, i've never had an accident. Every time i've done something wrong, it's changed my life. I have to take care of them, just like I have. I can't do everything I do when I go.We were both students at st. Peter's in france. We met when we were teenagers. A little older. He was a very nice man who liked to go swimming with me, and his girlfriend was a really good swimmer. He loved it. Then he was killed by police.We're both 18. He was 18 years old at the time. We were going to do our first year together. He would hang out with other boys in the gym. We wanted to learn the ropes and get a bit better at the sport.I was really lucky. I had a good friend there. She liked to go swimming or going for walks, so we would go for walks together. We didn't really have much time. I remember when I got there aroun...
602|You want him to know that he shouldn't put up with this. If I'm going to make a little money, I can pay him a lot of money. He's getting some.""Right," He said, "I'm paying the fees and paying the bills and paying for medical expenses. I didn't ask for anything. I mean, I wasn't making this to make money. I just wanted to help out, and that's really what we're doing right now."Towards the end of the interview, howard mentioned that he was trying out for a small-time artist, but after howard announced that he wanted to get involved in fashion and started doing other things with the public, he turned to his wife for help with his fashion. "When we started talking about this last summer in new york, they said, 'well, we're going to look into it.' And I said, 'i got your name in there for the project, and if we come to new york, we should do an interview. And if we get to boston, we should ask your name and tell you about the show and what you're making. And you've got to agree with me.'"The interview was so hot that howard and howard's other longtime friend, michael tormell, who worked at abc in philadelphia and eventually worked with him, finally decided to give the interview as a gift for howard's daughters. This led to some heated exchanges and ...
603|It happened a week ago; I'm in the hospital right now. I know the doctor is going to be coming to visit me in a few more minutes. We were in a car accident. I've never experienced anything like this before, and so my parents are going to come to visit me this morning. They've said, "There's nothing you can do. We got two things left." I've never experienced this before, but the doctors are saying, "Oh, we've got to find our way. We've got to get you home. We've got to get you home. It's going to take us a lot longer." They've got to start to pull everything together; I'm just like, "We don't know what we're doing."Q. And you've had a big family change this year. Did you have to wait that long?A. Yeah, I didn't. I got to get older. And then I got older. And I felt like, "Oh, my god, I gotta work harder right now." And I got to move away from it. And I had to get younger as well. So, I don't want to be the person who's going to feel like I'm having so much. Like, "What am I feeling now? I don't know. I feel awful."Q. But you haven't had a big family change since you got married.A. Because no...
604|In a very important meeting with my family to tell you about what we went through, after you got married at the age of 16, there was a guy named tony who I met at disneyland on the way to a cruise. He was a big ol' kid. He had a big, big smile on his face. He was very big, but he did have a big, big heart, and he knew what it was like to not have that smile. We had a really good time, then we went off to disneyland and I sat with my dad and we talked to people there. We all had a nice and nice time. We were pretty happy with ourselves. The next thing you know, we're with somebody that is 20 or 30, and they're talking about you and you're like, "I really like you." You really like yourself and you know what they're talking about. So I think you're like, "Okay, okay." We'd probably see each other at the next park, and you know what, I like to put on that smile.Q: I just heard it said that mickey mouse was involved with a lot of bad behavior in his life. Is it true?A: he's been caught several times by the police trying to get him to make money for them, but he never made any money at all. He got caught and was held in the county jail at the first sign of trouble. He was taken to the county jai...
605|I was about twenty-one in 1980 and I went in front of the newspaper and said, "Sir, I don't even know what is in this newspaper." And, I asked, "Sir, how does this happen?" He said, "I've been to all the newspapers but I can tell you the most unusual thing I know about it. For the first time in my life, I have all this information I did not know. This is the first time I have the power of information. This is the first time I have the power to change the world. This is the first time that I have the power to make everyone better. And the first time that I has the power to make that kind of world a better world, I will do it because I have the chance to. Because I have the power.Amy goodman: so you have been in this field for about thirty years and you won the nobel prize for science a couple of years back. I mean it's the last time you were nominated for the nobel peace prize. So what's your message to the world, you're saying?Sen. Richard lamar: well, there's probably two ways at least I hope it—because it can be hard to tell the difference between an award that is to the country and one that goes to the world. And I think we need to take action on that, take every step to make this very important. I mean, i'v...
606|my first time working at the department, when I was a junior, I was asked to perform a task I was very good at. It was a challenge and my first task was to perform a "Task" With a group of the department's most senior employees. When I wasn't on-duty, my work was done in a room.My friend, an assistant engineer, helped me do that project. After I was assigned a task, we'd try to get into a conversation. He always tells me, "I'm going to be a bit late to the party." But I think he was right about the importance of being "On time."I was an early adopter for such a task, which was quite different, but I enjoyed it.Now I'm in my 60s. I've become a great writer, a brilliant, very good student.I started to go along with projects and try to get my story told with the right people in both my time and life. I worked in retail so I could get some good feedback from the other staff, and I was very successful in my career.I got paid a couple thousand dollars to produce a commercial for the new york times, and I'd been working at a publishing house during my tenure there for about 20 years, and there were several people who have written for the new york times.I've tried not to be as selfish as I could for s...
607|I was visiting a friend at a party and they had just gotten to a party. I came over and I was talking a bit and they were giving out free stuff to students. I asked them what kind of gifts they were giving out and they said that they were going to give a free one to a friend and then they gave it back to me and they said they would give me a free one for my whole life. Well now my friend is sick and I was sick for like three days while they were giving free stuff. So now I was just waiting for them to give me that and I was like, who are they going to give me something to put that into and then they started asking me questions about them in class about a couple things. So I was like I don't know. It turns out my friend that was given the gift was a free one. So she was like, I'm giving you money for free things.I looked at her and she looked at me like, oh my god, you just gave me $500 worth of free stuff. So that's that. That is what I was doing. So I turned to the guy that was giving them the gift and he was like, you know what, I'm like, you're doing free things and I'm doing nothing and she said, I'm not giving that to you. I'm giving this for my whole life.Sj: so you're the kind of guy who wants t...
608|It was not my fault, I had to be honest. I just really don't think people realize what a disaster that has been. I think it's all about your self-worth. I just really don't think that people take it seriously enough.If the word "Failures" Makes you feel bad, that's because I don't know how much it helped me cope with it. People often tell you that there "Just weren't enough things" To worry about. So how did I deal with the pressure of writing for these people?I didn't know what to expect. They asked if I was ready, and they asked about the book, and it was really embarrassing. I was scared. I remember the first time I had heard such a thing, and I think I was just terrified of that. I mean, I wasn't even sure if I was going to do the book or not.I had just finished the second book and I got asked if I was ready because they asked me if I was ready for my other books. They were just kind of asking me, what's the point of all this? I said that I was waiting for my family. No way. I didn't know any better. I really wanted to try it, but I was also just not sure what to expect. So when I said "Why didn't I already try it," I was like, "Why did you do that, you should've done i...
609|It was about the time I got a promotion from the company and was hired by them to fill one of their marketing positions with somebody who wanted to do some stuff. So I went into a big office and worked with a guy who looked like the guy who's going to do that stuff and got promoted. He was a good, hardworking guy who was kind of the kind of person you'd expect to get a promotion to as a brand manager, you know. But when I got called in I was like, "What is this guy doing here?" And I thought I was going to get a promotion, but he didn't give me one. He just came in and he looked at me like, "You know, what is up with that guy, that company, you know? He's got his hands full creating products, but he's a little too busy with marketing to work for you." So that was it. He left, didn't want to work for the company anymore, and I went to get my promotion." I'm like, "I gotta go work at this company where the marketing guy's been doing marketing for 10 years, and he's a lot more efficient than you guys. I'm not going to say my boss was wrong. He was really right."Weird al: it's pretty funny how he was always so excited about a job. He went out to lunch, but, like, he never gave anyone a clue.Steve: yea...
610|I love it, and I love your book, because it's the thing that made me want to give it a go. You're not just going to give it a go. You're going to give it to me, and you're going to give me what I want to give it to you. And I know that people don't want that, but I don't care. I don't want people judging me, nor do I care that people are looking into my life in this way. I'm not trying to give an excuse for any of this behavior, and I'm not trying to give a blanket condemnation of any of it. All I am saying is, "If you can get to hell and back with it, I'llstick with it." I don't care what people think. I just want them to know how much they value my time."The last time I was interviewed was for a piece in time magazine. The interviewer asked: "What's your story about your ex and how does that make you feel?" And I said, "You have an ex who is extremely proud of her life. So, how do you feel? Is it different for her to be proud of her life than it is to have her work it and be happy, and do it all so she can pay her bills? And that's a good perspective. How does your character feel about that?" And I said, "What happens when you have so much that it makes yo...
611|When I was about three years old, my dad brought me some really old bottles of liquor. I was an expert at finding the right amount of alcohol that we would use during our trips together. So I started going to the liquor store. That's when I remember, there you go. We've just been back from vietnam. You know, we were on a plane. They said, "You're not allowed to bring any of that stuff, sir," And we were kind of looking for some kind of a big bottle of whiskey you'd keep. But we found a big bottle in the back of the store, and we were told we couldn't bring anything else. Then I took the big bottle out and I brought it up to the store. And every time I turned to see it, it popped out and I had to tell my parents what it was.When you were on your own when you were 9, you had to deal with the kids. You had to deal with the family.Oh, and if my dad did end up going into college and being a great student and doing things like that, I would do a lot worse than him.Yeah, you could really hear you saying that.Yeah, but I couldn't hear you say anything.Yeah, I thought you would be fine.But that's your story. That's my story. And I had no idea I could say to someone like me, lik...
612|You and I were going to get married when a lady named bethany came in to see you. I was so excited! She was so lovely! And then there's this other one, which happened to be a pretty girl named charlotte. Well, you know that charlotte is the daughter of the governor and a woman of the south. I don't know. And you go out to meet her and she gave you a beautiful letter. So you go to charlotte and she asks you where she's seeing charlotte. She says there is charlotte's home in the woods. Well, I believe she's seeing charlotte's house. But she says that's not what charlotte is looking for. She said she doesn't remember that. You know what? This lady, I mean, she's my wife, but she is not a woman of god. If I were her husband I would not be here. I would not be here. I don't take it well. And charlotte said, 'i never told you I was married,' and you say, 'oh, you do remember that?' And she was very gracious. So she gets home and says, 'well, I never told you what I was going to ask you. I think I told you it would never work.' And she is very gracious. And then you go off and tell the story about it. So you've just finished it. But, you know, I didn't want to tell you why I was going to tell you...
613|Last year, we were having a party for a big concert on the same night, and there was a whole bunch of kids in a little group that were playing. They were playing music, but it was a very loud party, and they didn't sound much like the music around. And they just started to play. They said, "Wow, this whole party sounds like a party, and I'm just going to turn them down. And I'm going to make sure they are all in here by then." So I said, "Okay. Go take a picture. Don't show me." And they took the pictures. And I said, "Okay. We're just going to play and show you." I said, "Cool, maybe you can go a little bit further. This is the last time we would do something like that." And the music started to turn and people were coming up and going into the party. It was just a really loud party. And then the kids just started to go home and say, "This is so crazy. This is where the music went wrong." So I was like, "You know what, I'llget back to you."And then there came a year later (laughs) when the party that we had happened to be in was over. And when I arrived at the house, I told them that the party was over. After that, I was like, "I don't want to do nothing for the kids." An...
614|My house is a lot nicer than I used to be, and it's easier for us to stay within walking distance of home. We get to hang out, play around, eat, go shopping. My mom just has more of the kids on a tight budget than I do today and I have one family on my list. I'm not sure if that makes a difference or doesn't, but I think it keeps the kids there. My mom did something special, so she's not alone.It's been nice to have more of my friends. I'm surprised I don't get to see my mom in person. No one can see my mom at all. Her phone's gone. I'm like I'm a stranger.I started playing with my mom around 5 p.M. And she never responded.And then I started walking home.I'm on the phone with my grandma the other day. She says we're all playing tag. I think that's what we say. We're friends and I can't remember when we were friends but we know it's okay. She says we have a lot of questions, and that's what you have to ask.This is how you get started. You start with talking to mom, and if she hasn't responded yet, you can call my mom. If she has, call my grandma. She'll make sure you're talking to your mom or an aunt or a grandma...
615|Your father was a big fan of mine so I think it's important to tell him about this story and how I fell in love with my niece. It's a love story that has a different tone and some of the things that happen in it, so we're doing it right.I really enjoyed it. Was it all really interesting?I think it was a fun story because we met all the people in the cast at one place. I think that's what keeps the cast very grounded and I think every cast person you meet is connected too, and I think that's what made the characters different. There is a lot of chemistry but I'd say that I was the funniest one.Did you have any feelings for your mother? Was she there to talk to you?She said she was so happy for me. She said she's always happy for me. I think her love for me also was great.What was your relationship like back then?I was just a kid in school. I did my first school dance so it's like the kid's a princess now. You have to get to get to school in a school uniform, I'm not that kind of kid, so you have to go to school and take a picture with the girls, so that's where you go. It was so crazy! It was so weird! It was amazing!What was it like watching the cast of parks and recreation...
616|You're probably telling me that a couple of years ago you decided to go out onto the balcony. There are two things you could do. One is to just stand there a few feet away from me and scream. The other is to do the same thing while standing on your own, just stand there in front of an empty theater. Just stand there for ten seconds, don't move, and just run out of the room. But when it's over, you know it's over. No more yelling, no more screaming. There was a time when you were able to stand still in an empty theater. Now you do it like this. Do all you can to keep doing the old things that you used to do. I'll let you try this. Don't say it like that again. The second thing that you did that you can't remember is that you had a great time. You came in and out of this theater, didn't you? Oh yeah? That was all right. Yes, now you came in like you told me to come in and out of all that. You're good at it. I'm really glad you came in. You should have come out. Oh no, I don't think the guy in the front seats of the theater got the job done. He was running along the balcony railing. And it looks like there's some kind of fire going under him. He's been doing a lot of firework stuff lately too. Oh my lord. Ther...
617|You don't go out with a few hundred bucks worth of food and all you're doing is keeping the city running at full capacity and all you're doing is getting in the way of the competition and making people feel like they're not entitled to an affordable, well-run, high-quality, safe city.If I look at all these people, I can tell you that they're not fighting back at what I'm doing. They're fighting back at the fact that I get paid as a contractor and that they're doing what I'm doing. And you're in that job for a reason. You're a part of what makes this city great. This city is in this business right now. If somebody told you that, you would be on their list of people that would work for you. I wouldn't hire people like that. It's a business. It's my job. I want you to be on a plane to see this city be ok all over again.I was in charge of all of that. I thought I would let you do it. I wouldn't put you in charge of a government department unless I thought you were doing a good job.You're a part of the problem. I want you to bring it up. I'm not going to put it up. It's a job. You're going to be in charge of it until you figure out to what extent you need to let the public pay you back...
618|You're all in college and everything is going great, you're trying to do a couple jobs to make ends meet, you're doing good and you're being a great company owner. But the reality is, you're all in college and all you have to do is do your college degree. And as an example, you know, you have to have two jobs as a stock trader and a financial executive, and you're supposed to make a living by doing those two jobs. So this is a job that is so far from reality because of the reality that most of us don't have.Bill moyers: well, no doubt there still are those who will say, okay, what about you? And i've just asked the question—there is no truth in it, I thought. And I don't think there is anything wrong with that.Juan gonzález: so you're doing the job that's not what the average person is supposed to do.Narrator: no, no, no, that doesn't matter. So what's wrong with it? There's no right answer. There's really no right answer. You know, you're all in college and you're trying to do two jobs that are so far from reality because of the reality that most of us don't have. I mean, we all do the job that's supposed to be done.

619|In 2001, three young men from the area, including a brother, took a girl hostage, took her and took her off him. They were looking for money. The mother was so upset that she went into a coma. The young man said he wanted her dead and threatened to use some money. She said he would use it on a car and kill her, but the parents did not. He was arrested. He later pleaded guilty to the assault charge (1).The case is about money and this was because he said they would need a bribe to do so. The family of the girl was involved in this case. The family is the majority of the money in the family. And that's what the police were called to the house. They found the money there. And the woman was so scared that she said something to the man so he wouldn't listen to her. He said, "Listen to me. I'll kill you. I'll kill you every day."It was a real danger to any good police officer on the street.[a man called to appear to help a hostage, who is taken out of the house, and shot at by police is seen in this footage, and it is unknown if the man died or was shot at by police.]the two men were both charged with attempted murder or attempted murder of a minor. One of the parents claimed they had been trying to get money from the child to help the hostage. H...
620|One of the things that happened to me that night was that I was so much more interested in going back in time then where I was, and doing what I wanted to do with my life. I was going through a different life. I was going through a different time, my relationships were getting strained, I was thinking about the future and it was too late to let it go now. I went on record saying I wanted to go back in time. I said nothing about the next three years, but my father, the father that came to my family, that was me, that was my father. And then the thing that happened to me was that I was going through a different life. You didn't really know when what happened next made sense for you.What do you think about the media's coverage of the trump administration? Do you wish he had resigned?Well, the president is going to fire a lot of people, and those people are going to be charged criminally if they don't resign. I wish he was serious, and I wish he would have given a better warning to people. I think we've already seen him do that. He's going to make a terrible mistake.The trump family is on fire and it hasn't worked out. Is there anything that the media needs to do to prevent this from happening again in the future?I think the media is just going to have to figure this out by themselves. If they think th...
621|i was in chicago the day before the chicago bears went down to the green bay packers. I was in the hotel at the time and I couldn't get to my room because I was in pain. At that time, I had been through some very tough times. That was the cold weather that had just hit and it was a tough time to deal with it.I told my friends, "You'll be fine. I'm going to go to the hospital. You're in good hands. I'll take care of you.""We just got out of there by that time."I was right there with him. He said, "You're gonna get a concussion. You're going to be fine. We're gonna be out of there by this time....
622|this was my first summer, and I had just got pregnant. We had had a baby boy, and the baby boy had a lot of issues and things that had happened, especially with his parents (my mother). So we were just sitting at a cafe and I was thinking, well I can make a new baby, I guess i've been living a normal life. I just started thinking about how I could change that. One day, it was a very real feeling to be having a normal life. After about three months, when I was really sick, and I was really sick, I had a stroke and had an appointment with my doctors. So I was out in the car, my dad was talking to everyone, and I saw what you're talking about.I went to my gp, and he asked me, "What's the treatment you're going to give me?" And he was, "It will help with nausea," And I was like, wow, that's amazing. But I don't think i've ever given any other way I can get relief. I mean, what is it? Well I can try to get some kind of relief and i've seen a number of doctors that would say it's not going to work, and they won't do it. So i've just been trying to make something happen for my baby, and there's no cure.So now there is a big plan. I'm hoping and praying that I ca...
623|i was in the middle of dinner with a great many friends who were trying to make a decent meal. We were both watching a film and we were trying to find a way to make it sound like an italian restaurant.Then I heard my friend's father say, "I want to go for a walk with my daughter."Well, I knew I was going to walk around, but not with him.Well, he went out for a walk with my daughter, and he says: "Well, I'm going for a walk with you."And then there was two guys coming up the stairs to her house. I said: "Excuse me, I'm going with my daughter, but you can't be the guy who walks with your daughter." And said, "No, if you want to come, you can come here."And the next day my daughter was playing with my daughter at the play. She was really enjoying the play.And when she asked, "What are you doing here?" I told her, "I'm playing on my computer. I'm doing all kinds of stuff." And she said, "Oh, my god, that's wonderful....
624|I used to live in south africa, but when I was in america, I used to go to the south pole. I was a very poor child, and I was going to spend time there for the rest of my life, because I was going to give up all my money and all the things I loved and stuff like that. I started talking to the other kids about it, and there was this beautiful kid in nigeria: he's a great guy, he's a good guy, he's an african kid. I was like, "Yo, man, that's a story!" This kid said, "Yo, man, that's a story! He's an african kid!" And I said, "Yo, man, man, man!" And he was like, "Yo, man, man! That's a story!" And I thought, "It's pretty amazing," And then I started to go and read about it.Do you remember talking to this kid about it?He was like, "Yo, man, man, man, man, man!" And I came back and said, "You can make a really good story about this kid, man." And he was like, "What story?" And I said, "Yeah, man, man, man." And he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah! That's a good story. That's a good story!"He said, "Okay. You can make a really goo...
625|I was an editor at one of the biggest digital magazines. I published about 20 stories a year. When I was doing this, I actually received a lot of mail, so I kept in touch with publishers. Eventually it got there.But I was only able to do a handful of stories in the last few years because of how little I did. There were just a handful of stories that people had seen, and I was like, "Wait!" And started to get interested. When they realized that they'd been following me all through the years, a lot of people started buying me stuff because I was so good at that stuff.How did the rise of facebook become part of your overall goal?That was my idea. I was like, "Ok, I'lldo a bunch of stories in a week." Then they said, "You know, if you can write ten stories a week and do 10 stories and get through six weeks, we'll pay you." It was just a little part of it.What was your experience at facebook doing for you?I was sitting there in my office and reading about the news. I thought, this is what we want. I'm a journalist, people. Everyone has to know how to read the news. No one can read the news.What did that have to do with the shift in your personality? One of the things I really liked about facebook was that you could have the sam...
626|I have been watching my daughter grow up a big family, and I want her to understand that there are a lot of different choices that have to go up the road to be successful in life. When you have a child that wants to learn something from her dad, you go to the next step. And my first thought is, what would she want to be learning in order to succeed in today's society? And how does that lead to success? My daughter did it. She started reading a book called "The best of the best" And that was that. She got it. And I don't think she'd ever have gotten that far. And my daughter wanted to be an entrepreneur. But she was a little late for that. And all my other daughter friends were like, "It's ok." They were all so scared of taking her away and that's how much it is now. People don't realize how difficult it is to take someone's love and turn it into an idea. They're doing it in this way, and you're putting them to work. They are not trying to have it all.Q: what about when did you first find fame and wealth? Have you ever had a relationship and have you ever had some type of trouble?A: i've been very lucky with that kind of luck since childhood. I've never had an incident where I got hit by a train.

627|After our little kid got married, it was my fault. The first guy I asked that day would never have a baby with me. We thought we were a family. When I saw my mom, I wanted to say, "Mommy, I'm sorry!" But it only took a couple months, and I was still scared of him. I told him just how bad he was but I didn't want him to try to get pregnant. I'm still scared every day. He is a really good kid and I love him and all the girls. I love and respect him. He is the most intelligent kid i've ever met. He's so thoughtful. He makes the best decision for his family. He just gets more and more creative and creative. It's so hard. We didn't realize that we made a terrible decision at the age of 11." What do you think of the results so far with the new movie?"We're in love with the new character, who is also a wonderful character. One of the things I love about her is if she's a nice person, she's charming. She's funny, not afraid to be herself. She's also super cute, and she's a little less angry. She does everything in her power to try and get people to believe her. I think it's very much a good movie, and it's going to be a big hit. I think the big thing is how good it makes it. It's ...
628|I'm an artist. I love to create stuff. And a lot of people would like to be able to have ideas in their heads. At night I'd just watch them and I'd be able to imagine how they were going to react. I'd put my thoughts into my head, let them express themselves, but then my mind would just become a tool for the listener to make that sense to him or her.The first time I did a book I just started thinking about how I was using the words to express myself. Why was that? I'd try and find a way to describe things. How did I find the words? I'd look at my characters and if a word seemed to fit where they were, I'd look for other words I hadn't thought of. I'd start to think about other things, but I'd also be able to express myself through the words. But I couldn't see anything. I was just imagining things that hadn't happened. I just couldn't see any way I could. I didn't know where they were, and they weren't there either. So it was just so overwhelming. It was like, "I'm so crazy. It's so wrong and ridiculous to try and explain what it is." That is the way I came up with this idea of being able to use words. That is the way we communicate the words. It's all based on what we already understand.Are you having nightmares?S...
629|When I was growing up in the 1960s, nobody was going to think about what you were doing. It was all a big joke. I started thinking about my parents, my friends, my teachers because they would never give up on me and their sons. I was very lucky, because they were all very nice people. My parents are from the south, my parents are from the west. I was always very good at school but the teachers who came from the south were always very nice people, so I learned not to let them down. So I was very lucky. I really wanted to be a nurse because I could get it all done myself. Even when you think about what I went through, I feel extremely thankful for it. It would be nice if I could have my own personal space.But at that time, I don't feel like I could do my own thing. I never wanted to give up. I was very much influenced by things in the west. The south had a real problem. What I could do with my life didn't exist in the south or south korea. I'm a japanese american. I was born in japan. I grew up in south korea. So my parents were just kind of supportive. They were nice. My mother was really supportive.My father didn't give me so much of an influence on how I grew up. He was a big fan! He was a big fan of everything that you were doing, and he wa...
630|about a year ago, I was working for the cia in san francisco. When I first started working there, I had a few different missions to do, including a group at cia southeast, that would do a series of operations that would require my personal time and money. I had to do a huge amount to keep up with all of that. I was a consultant at the time and was responsible for a lot of the operations that had to go on. So, during this time, I got a lot of money, which I thought was pretty good, but what I didn't realize was that I was being funded by a big company that would do a lot of this for me and a bunch of different projects that I wanted to do. So I had to write off a bunch of my personal time.So that's when I realized I was not being supported by the cia for that kind of stuff — that my career as an nsa contractor really wasn't that much.Right.I had a job and was a contractor a year or two after my internship, and I was still doing that. And then, when I left that place, I got a job at the cia.Right.I'm not sure why, but when I was there, I was doing stuff that nobody wanted to do with me and I had to work hard to get this internship and then I got another job at the cia, where I sort of got this jo...
631|On the night of august 9, 1975, I was standing in front of the home of my friends and I was doing a job with them. I was a little nervous, and we were going to have a dance. So I said, "Come on." So the dancers had to dance that night. Then I went into the house and they said, "No, we wouldn't want to perform tonight." We said, "Well we got a dance tonight, too." So we did that. They took us home and danced around like they weren't there to sing. One of the queens went, "What's going on?" I said, "She's going to dance." They were very serious. But then I started thinking about something else. It took a while, because the guys were still working. But then all this time i've been thinking about the little people. They always seem to be in the mood for something. They're always there with you. They have a song in their heads, with us, and the other dancers. Sometimes they're in the house watching movies. And I was thinking about it, and I kept thinking. The guys are so nice. They have a good time. They love to take your work. They like to give you a little something. So it was like, "What's going on with her?" I thought about it, and I said, "Well I haven't seen her in a while. I can tell you that the danc...
632|I'm a teenager, right? And I used to play basketball and play baseball. And i'm, like, 40, 40. A lot of times, I think my dad's getting in the way, and i've played baseball before, but I just have these questions, like, why can't I play in baseball? Why can't I play college football?You know, I'llsay that. I'm 27. And I'm watching the simpsons right now. And I just started thinking, "Oh, i've never seen a show like this. I don't know how it ended. It feels like a fairy tale." Then, it became a little bit out of control. And I wanted to try and make this new show not have a fairy tale, a whole lot of fairy tales, but at the same time, a real fairy tale. And I thought, "Oh yeah, it's time to play an nba. I don't know who's gonna be going to the lakers. I don't know who they wanna be."So I was like, "Okay, well, this is one of those things where we're all going to love it, and we're all going to want to try to tell it. We're all going to be in this world together, we're all going to want to play basketball, we're all gonna want to be in this world together. We are going to try and figure it out. But there's somethin...
633|when mike and I walked into john ritz's apartment one night, they went to sleep in their beds. I took michael's phone, and we had to go through a couple of things. 1) the phone was on the other side of the room where the two of us lived. We took the phone. We walked downstairs to where john was in jail, he was just going through some paperwork. 2) outside was a bunch of people. He had just come out from work and was having a few drinks.I went up to him to ask him what was going on and I told him he had no idea what was going on. So, we sat down and I didn't want to go into details."Well, mike, I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you that he's going to tell you that. He's going to tell you that they're going to tell you that. That they're going to tell you that he's going to tell you that he knows you're not going to like it. And he's going to get you to tell him what she told you. And to tell you something. He's going to get you to get him to tell you this.I said, you know, I'm sorry."Mike, that's your mommy." I said, I'm not going to.He said, no, mike. "Well, tell me wha...
634|at the time, two of my kids were sitting at a restaurant, and one asked me "Why is there a red light?" We told him to get out, and he would. When he got out with no warning, I looked around, and saw another guy on a bench trying to run toward me. I went to look and see where he was going, and he was going through the aisle.It would be like a slow death, because I couldn't get out, because I was really scared.The next thing you saw, you're looking at a guy who's about 20 years old with a small beard, wearing sunglasses and a t-shirt, wearing a red t-shirt.Right. Right.And then you're in front of that guy and you're trying to take this dude out of his mouth, and it just kind of just went downhill.You know, I just had this sense of frustration. I knew I'd had enough of this kid, but I wasn't used to it, I was just trying to make sense of it. And he told me that I was supposed to go up to him and help him. I wasn't supposed to do that, I was just going about my normal life as I normally would; because I was just trying to make sense of it, and I wanted this kid, that just felt right, and I wanted to help him, but he just kept telling me tha...
635|We were both very nervous. And there were other things we were worried about. I'm sorry for you. In a way, it was a moment of total calm that we never had. But there was a big fight happening. There was a very serious fight going on."Kubrick then went on to describe the scene where he says he met kim. "We were in the parking lot and he was sitting in front of the car. It was just me, a young man, a little, he did not look like kim at all, I don't know. And I was shaking and he was crying a little bit at that point, I think about that."Kim then described the fight as well."And I remember, he started to cry. Like, 'daddy!' But I remember he's like, 'what's up?' And I remember we just hugged. And then, I remember he got up from bed and he was shaking and that was it. But there was a second fight that went on a little bit longer. He had some fights and he got very upset. And then we kind of went to bed, and I remember crying. And I think it was really sad to tell him that we had a big fight. It wasn't like I was getting angry, but like I said, he really wanted my money. And I think because he got a good deal, that he wanted to go in there and fight, they had ...
636|it began about 8 years ago with the release of star wars: episode iii revenge of the sith. Now you can take this and make your own movies, play video games and do a lot of stuff from the movie and take it with you wherever you are.You can find video games on gog.Com here and you can order video games for your vr headset here.So how did this start?The idea of vr arrived. It was the idea of being able to connect with people that you could not connect with offline. The idea of having this wonderful platform that you could just play with a friend or with friends that you can play with anywhere you want, and if you needed to play in vr for a few days you could play it but if you needed to play in the rest of the world the game would be just fine.We started putting in the vr headset. We put some headset into an old pc that came with a playstation controller. We had some idea that would be that really cool for vr.But the whole process of doing this started with a lot of hard work. We didn't start at $10. It's not like we were going to make a $80 game for this price. It took maybe a month to get it going.The first thing we did was to find some way to make the game play. We had a couple of really interesting ideas which we thought were very cool, w...
637|In 2006, an ad in the washington post asked, "Is there something very wrong with donald trump?" The response was clear: if trump doesn't want to be inaugurated, we've already had enough.A few weeks after that piece was published, I wrote about the same problem on twitter and in the new york times. An article by mark steyn, the ceo of the american enterprise institute, called it "An unprecedented attack on the republican party, a slap in the face to the populist ethos of our country and the promise of a country that is fundamentally different and closer to the spirit of the republican party than any other."Steyn doesn't mean that trump is a xenophobe. I know many of his critics. But his approach is different than his standard approach to other issues. He is a more straightforward character. He likes to see the american people speak out, to be heard, and to understand that as a person, it is the only right thing to do.But he also is more than a character, a conservative thinker. He loves the republican party. His message is clear and is deeply rooted in the american traditions of american conservatism. His ideas have resonated with millions of americans, and that resonated in the 2012 presidential election, as well as the 2012 republican convention and the general election. He is a realist and a realist has to be on his side. It's a challenge. The way to do it is to pu...
638|This is why I was in los angeles, and it's why I ended up on the show. I came up here a little bit, I fell in love with something we had all grown up with and I remember looking over at the guy on the street, "I want to see how he does it that way." Then I went, "Yeah," So that's the story. That was the first day I saw him.So when I was 10, I started watching my mother talk to him in the bathroom and she said, "What's up?" So it was a little too early for me.So I was like, "Wow. I see you love this guy so much, you didn't expect that he'd be this good with us." And then I knew how much I loved him. I loved everything he had to offer. If anybody is going to come visit this guy to meet his kids, they're going to meet this guy. I wanted to meet him to see if he was good with people and people that I liked. I was the type of guy that would make a show and do a show. I wanted him to have this life of his own. This one person that he was in it with, that was in it for so long, and he was great. What happened was there was this big, huge, big crush on me. His parents were just like, "Hey, you're such a nice person." I love that ...
639|in april 1997, I was about twenty-four years old. I was writing for an international magazine, and I was visiting the country I was writing for. I walked through a field with a friend. Our country was in shock, and there were no journalists here. When we met, the man with the big black hat said: "I saw that you were trying to sell me a picture of the world championship. I hope you're gonna sell me an image of your own." He told me that he had a picture of what I was really looking for, and that, somehow, he and I had to go out to talk. In the meantime, I was getting really creative, trying to find ways of expressing the kind of ideas that I was trying to express.That same year, in july of that same year, I was having a birthday party with my cousin, who was born seven months ago. She was really into photography. I was going to a party in a big high school at that time, and I got a call from her parents, saying: "Mr. Puckett, you know that I bought this photo for you, and I'm going to send it to you, and if you don't do it, I'm going to take it home to you when I'm ready to be out here on the field." And I got a call from an agent in germany at that time, and I was thinking, "What if this isn'...
640|i was a 19 year old senior at a college preparatory school with a history of depression. I started to use some of the same drugs and other stimulants. So that's where I went to college. One of the first things that happened to me was that my high school senior year ended up being the hardest one, that I remember the first time I felt like a drug in my life. I used to have a panic attack because I was using drugs that seemed to affect me. But that's kind of how my life ended up.Why does that happen in your day-to-day life?Because the world revolves around you and it's all about you, not just myself. So I really think that i've been through it a little bit, because I wanted to be part of something that really mattered.Do you have an identity with your drug use?I don't have any, I think. I have to do whatever I can to get that drug back. I do have to get this drug back, but I want to make this life as good, which I'm pretty sure is true, when you go through certain things you can do without taking the whole thing.Do you have any thoughts about who you might be?Nothing I'm going to say will get me into a lot of trouble. But I really hope that if these people come forward and we can get them to put their name on th...
641|I was one of the first black men to get a job — one of the finest men I ever had to employ. I was 18 years old and was working on a construction project in west memphis when I was approached by a male construction engineer who asked me if I could paint. I was excited at the idea and took him to me and said, "Are you interested in painting?" And he said, "Yeah. I'm interested in painting. It's a cool project, but I'm not interested in getting a job. I want to be able to paint my house." I couldn't work, and he said, "I'm not interested. I want to be a painter and try to create something."And that's when he wanted to work with me. I said, "How do you paint your house?" I told him how I painted the roof. He said, "Oh, you can do that." I said, "I can, but I want to have a career. I want to paint the back of his house." He said, "You need to let yourself go." And I said, "I'm not interested in painting other people's houses. I want to see something that is beautiful. I don't want to paint cars or anything."So while I was working on the project, I went to a car dealership for a quote. They said, "We want someone who can paint you. You'll get some work. We want someon...
642|in august, 1999, I was driving and the speedometer on the windshield of my car struck a pedestrian. My wife and I were very ill and we had to go to the hospital to get our blood test. My wife started crying because we were out of breath and my friend did not feel fine. We were taken to hospital with high blood pressure medication, and I was taken to the hospital for a blood transfusion for treatment of my chest pains from which I had to suffer for hours.I had spent the night in the same room with my family and I knew I had to get out there, be a part of something big. I thought about how I could put my arm around this girl and feel that she had no other option than to walk out in front of me. I was about to hit her head, but she did not move. I took her face in my arms, and I knew at that moment that the pain would be unbearable for the rest of my life. I would get up and walk her off the bus at 15,000 feet and to the nearest hospital where it seemed like maybe she would be alive. But if I walked her off the bus, the pain would be so unbearable and so much bigger that the entire world would just stop, it would become unbearable.When it came to getting to the hospital I was very ill, because I had to be very careful. Because I was in the hospital for about 18 hours straight, m...
643|The story is how I came to be here. I came here as an apprentice to the same people who run the world. The world is a maze of broken structures and broken machines. We all get trapped. I see my family. I know each day how bad things are. But not much happens. I was just born in a factory and the factory is completely closed, and everything is just broken and rotting. There is no medicine, and no hope. I can't even run the business. I am very weak and isolated. The only way I can get a job is to pay my debts to the government. I can't even get a job. I feel a great sense of hopelessness. I can't even walk down the streets. I'm living like any normal person of the world: with so much to lose. I've always known my place in the world, but we've become so lonely together. I don't know what to do about it.I feel like this moment of being here means that I am part of an even bigger story. A story of betrayal, of betrayal with respect to my country. I am so ashamed to say the word of this place.The thing about this is that I am the daughter of a great grandmother and a mother who used to live there. I wanted to know my grandmother's story, and what we've become, and I wanted to know every day that we are not alone. It was so strange. Bu...
644|I was in high school, when you get really smart. It's like being in a movie. In high school, you're an actor. In college, you're more like your brain is running and you're an athlete and so on.Do you remember seeing the first season on netflix?I wasn't really getting the chance to look at season 4 until the second season was out. I remember looking at it. It was like the beginning of the final season of the show. What's interesting about it is there was this idea that we're going to have to show a different cast at some point, because the last season of the walking dead was on netflix.You mentioned that the writers were talking about what they're doing now, and that season 3 will have a different cast. Do you remember any of that talk about season 3 being a "Real" Season, or was that just an idea as we knew what we wanted to do.Well, it was. We didn't think of season 2, as we had been going into it, but we actually did the second season and we had a series of events called 'the end' in season 1 and season 2. We had the first season and then there was a series called 'the bigger splash.' I think it was a lot of fun when we were writing.Do you recall when you saw a season 3 trailer?We shot our first trailer for season 3...
645|When my father was on the farm he was working. He came up to me on the farm and he said he was going to have a go at it. I went out and asked him what is this. He said, it is a cow. We had to stop. I said to him, it is not. 'I do not care if the cow is the animal but it isn't'. I went from there and that cow went on and on and on. But that was my little time. I thought, why is that, but I came to realise that this cow has a good side which doesn't go to sleep all that night. And I think that's my heart.When I was five years old I went home and went to school to give that school a test of where my friends thought they were going to get through some. I was five the first time I went there and I said, I don't know if I can do it. I came back a year later. So I got home and I thought, well, now I don't know how I did it. But the rest was fine. I was able to make friends with people. I had three and four years of experience.It never stopped after that. I didn't have too many friends. I did have a few friends but I wasn't a good leader. So I went to school. One day I came up to my parents and told them about a big deal. They sai...
646|The second we talk, there is a lot of chatter about what was going on. We hear about the fact that he was getting arrested in new orleans a week or two back, and I said, ok, if what he's saying is true, then I'm going to talk about what happened in new orleans. We've just heard a lot more about the way he's handled it and how little he understands about what happened. We've heard of him trying to figure things out and trying to come along and say, hey, I'm still here, and I understand some things, but it just took a while.Amy goodman: I want to talk about alonzo mourning, who came forward with his report earlier this year in the los angeles times. He's seen it many times in the news, in some newspapers. And what did you find? Well, you know, he was a young man who had just moved to new orleans and was working with the city's police department. And he says that he was a victim of an ambush by fellow officers. And as you say, your work ethic led him to go forward with his investigation. But you also know, there was one more thing he said that I think that's very important to note, which is that the fact that he's here in new orleans does not mean that what happened to you or that you're not going to be charged. That's what we've found. We have evidence of that, an...
647|I had my first crush of young girls when I was fifteen. They were all so nice and pretty. They were always dressed up like me, but they were just boys when they were with me. I hated them. They were really sad. I tried to get them out of those girls and into my mind a little bit, but they eventually calmed and gave my mind a little bit. They were a bit shy, but they were just a little bit more like me.There was no reason that I couldn't have my own little boy. He was always playing to my little ones for me and he always came right in my way. So when he came home, I told my dad all the way home. Even my two little girls who had been with me for the past year were so happy with him, they were so happy that I finally let them enjoy being with me. They were just a little bit nervous. I told my dad to take care of them until they had something that wasn't too risky, which he did.How long was your initial encounter with men?I started out in college. I felt like at nineteen, I was a really cool kid. I'd come from the same neighborhood where people were so hard to find. I was in the same classes, and I looked like an average student. I never really thought about men, but I had been attracted to a lot of men. And I never really thought about relationships. We'...
648|in august 2004, president george w. Bush announced the implementation of the patriot act, which was a massive tax cut for the wealthy. The bill, which was also known as the "Bills for work" Passed the house and the senate, with little opposition. And a few weeks later president george w. Bush signed the bill into law.Then on june 30, 2006, president bill clinton signed the patriot act into law. President clinton had been in office for just four months prior to this. In fact, the following day, president clinton signed the patriot act into law in the senate. This was actually quite a coup for president bill clinton, who was elected president of the united states in the fall of 2003. The bill also had a huge impact upon his policy on refugees from the middle east.While there were many benefits to supporting president clinton's policies on refugees, there were those who were opposed to the law. The aclu's john keeler, executive director, pointed out, "The president and his wife were given legal authority to take in all refugees they could get. The executive branch was also required to vet all americans seeking refuge, provided they were a legal refugee and they were willing to work, provided they were entitled to basic protections that the president and others were demanding."It was then that president clinton signed the bill into law.In his second year in office, bill clinton took i...
649|I was in vietnam working in the army during the vietnam war and I was wounded in the knee and I had to come back. So my family moved to san clemente and my dad and two of my sisters moved in with me. And my mother came in and said, "Look, we've got to move. We had a family that didn't give us our fair share of money. We really need help and it's going to cost us so much. That should put us in a special place. We don't have an equal place in this country like we have in most other countries."And my mother went to south vietnam, and she got out of jail and I was able to get out of prison because I had tried to go to a college in south vietnam. I was able to go to college, get paid in my community. In south vietnam and then a couple of years later, a couple of years after I returned to south vietnam in my early 70s and this guy came to kill me and I was able to move to california, which has an immigration policy that makes it illegal for people of color to come into the country. I'd been living in california for so long that I was finally able to move. And my family was able to move back to california, which was a very different place than they were in viet nam. My mom still lived here and my dad still lives here. And I was able to live here in a place that looked like i...
650|You're all in college and everything is going great, you're trying to do a couple jobs to make ends meet, you're doing good and you're being a great company owner. But the reality is, you're all in college and all you have to do is do your college degree. And as an example, you know, you have to have two jobs as a stock trader and a financial executive, and you're supposed to make a living by doing those two jobs. So this is a job that is so far from reality because of the reality that most of us don't have.Bill moyers: well, no doubt there still are those who will say, okay, what about you? And i've just asked the question—there is no truth in it, I thought. And I don't think there is anything wrong with that.Juan gonzález: so you're doing the job that's not what the average person is supposed to do.Narrator: no, no, no, that doesn't matter. So what's wrong with it? There's no right answer. There's really no right answer. You know, you're all in college and you're trying to do two jobs that are so far from reality because of the reality that most of us don't have. I mean, we all do the job that's supposed to be done.

651|i was a little boy, five years old, when I was diagnosed with epilepsy, and my parents took me to another school where the teacher had to administer a drug by the water pump or something. I was three for five. I was a very good kid.My parents had a strict strict rules that everybody was to follow. They had a lot of restrictions: everyone was to go home within the year. I was in a good school, so there was no problem. My mom would say, "You better take me a half hour and get up to class." But I did. I would stay up a whole lot more than the regular kids.And then my mom would say, "Just hang in there. It'll work."And I was like, "Oh my god, I can't do it. I can't do it. What's the point?" And everyone's like, "Oh my god, you're going to do this."But I learned that I had epilepsy. My parents, on the other hand, weren't worried about me. They had just been there. They were very happy. My mom kept telling them they hadn't to let me go home. When I went to school, they kept saying, "Let's go home. We'll get in a little car." I was like, "Oh no, we don't get in any cars." My mom was like, "We don't know wha...
652|It happened last year with our first president. The president was running for re-election after a bad election and he lost. He lost a lot less than he was trying to win. He campaigned in one place, and he got out in the third. We ran a campaign that got out in one place. And he failed. I don't understand why he was running in the third. It's not like he had any other strategy. He had no other plan. So even though he was not, he didn't get a call. So, we spent the next week campaigning. And that was a big mistake. And it was a big mistake, because no one saw the results and didn't have a second thought about what was happening. We spent a lot of time on that side of the fence in iowa, and it worked out, but nobody realized. So we started talking about this, and I was really concerned about what would happen if that happened to me. So we tried to get some help, and then we went to iowa and tried to find help that we could get to. And we found some things that we could talk about. We made some statements. And so, we began to work on that side of the fence, but we ended up on the wrong side of the fence.So I think the reason my own party is doing this is because they've got so many problems. They've got so many problems in the white house. A lot of the problem...
653|In 1999, I was sitting at home alone, in bed, and the house was engulfed in flames and all my clothes were on fire; my clothes were wet, so I put them on. I called the police and they picked me up. The cop shot me on the scene, and this happened over 12 minutes until I was dead.Jill: you were in your 30s, but didn't you have a boyfriend before, or was it just your imagination that led them to do this?David: I wasn't a real boyfriend. I went to a school, and I fell in love with my girlfriend. She was the biggest star on tv, but she also had a tv show, which was really hard to put together. I was living with my roommate. We were together for one month at a time, and she was the love interest for me. She was the one who got us together, but she wasn't my boyfriend anymore. She was a big part of my life. I'm like a parent to these girls. And as we were doing this, I said, "I want this, and I'm going to get it." She was like, "You know, you don't understand that, do you?"But it was very hard, because I told her everything that came with it. She said, "Well, I feel like I need you to tell me this, but I'm not a real boyfriend. I'm just ...
654|When we were in college in high school, we came to new york. We had a house where we didn't have to clean it, we had two bedrooms, and we had two people. One of them was just kind of like, 'oh, my god, this is so wonderful.' They'd take her home and they'd clean it. So we had three bedrooms. It was really lovely, and the house I lived in was in manhattan. So I had a lot of children and I was living in a house, and then we built a new kind of house.But I was also really, really bad at living on a lot of different floors, a lot of different kinds of stuff. I was in the basement of an old building and I lived in three different rooms and three different things, and when I did get to those three rooms, I found a basement, a very interesting basement. I found a lot of houses where there were no more windows. And I used to find a lot of different things, some of them more interesting than others in that basement. I'd buy things I had never used yet; I'd look at them and think, 'oh yeah, that's the best house i've ever seen.' I had a lot of that and then I'd buy new things and new things and new things.It was a fascinating project. I've always kind of been a little bit sort of, I think, a somewhat unemotional perso...
655|I was at a party, and there was a friend of my best friend. We were at a table and she had a bottle of water. She said, "Hey, you know how much you drink. I think your face should be red," And that was about it. I gave her the bottle. I asked her, "You know who you are?" She said, "No. What I do is I come back to visit you." And if you think I'm rude, I really am. It doesn't matter if I'm rude or not, I do what I say and you'll see. They are great people, the people that we are, I just don't know any better. So, let me tell you what I know for sure: I'm a total professional liar and I know full well that i've screwed you more times than you've known to be honest. I have to admit it; there's nothing that makes me more honest than lying. You know, when I told the story, I didn't mean for her to know about it. So I told her it looked like I was lying. So, she immediately started to laugh, and I told her I didn't mean to hurt her. When I was getting ready to go to bed, I looked at her. And she immediately laughed and said, "Yeah, so what are you laughing at?" And then I went to bed and she was sitting there with all her other friends. That's whe...
656|When my father-in-law's widow had a baby and she had been so anxious about it, she would come to our house in the summer, which is now the old school, and tell us if it was safe to have her. She was like, "What? It's a safe school?" And I said, "No, it is. It is really safe in that school." And she came in and did so, but you know, i've never seen a safe school.D: it was kind of amazing! The first thing she said was, "You look like you're supposed to be getting a nice home. And then I just came over and gave you what your mother-in-law did." She started crying, and she started telling us about how she lived in her little house and had a great house. And I asked her if it was safe to give her this baby! She said no, she was just going to be careful, and then I started taking notes on her handwriting, and I got her to do some things on it, and I just started writing again and again, and I kept getting her to write back in, and then I started getting her to write on my bed when her mom always told her that when I took her to the hospital, if she needed to write down anything about herself, she would help me do it instead of giving me this baby. And she was so nervous that I kept telling her and telling he...
657|I was trying to come up with something about a group of kids that wanted to be part of the movie. And I couldn't make any sense of it. So I went and told them what they needed to hear, and they said the story is something that really interested me and a lot of people in the movie. And I said, "Well then who do you think you're going to be doing with this?" They said, "Yeah, I hope you've got your own stories to tell." So I went and told it that way and started writing a script, and I think it got a lot of attention that people were saying, "Well, you shouldn't have told this."Was it a surprise to you that your script came out so quickly?I think it was a surprise because nobody knew what to expect.Then there was that big, big, big surprise when you were getting in touch with director david s. Goyer.I was with him. We shared our feelings for a long time. I also brought up the possibility that we'd come up with something about the movie, and he would try to tell me how it went, and I thought, "Oh, I wouldn't have been able to find a way to tell this." And I think that's one of the things about the movie that I realized.But you also tell about it.I was telling him about it. I told him about i...
658|You have been out of town for two weeks and, well, you went to work at the store and at least in a few days you got a job.A very hard working kid who has been working for a long time in the company for three very long years. And you said that he doesn't have any friends in the world. So you said, "Oh that's right, I have friends in the world."You had six kids. And you had one of them named bob. The other was named judy. And you had three more kids in the company. And you said that bob will eventually be working here. And judy said oh no. Bob would come back and live in hawaii. And you said that it'll be more like this house and bob, like I said if judy would come, you'd have an option. And it was a very hard choice.And you said, "Let's just get rid of jerry and get a place like this and let's do something like this." And that was the way it did it.It's very hard to say, but I think this year we got some really good business. We got some great movies and people are doing amazing stuff. That's all you do.What's the story of this new place, how well does it meet the needs of a person who lives in an office and is already in a family?Here we go back to the old on...
659|I worked in a big hotel and came upon what I thought was an old school bathroom. The bathroom was really dirty. All of that happened in a month. So I walked out, my clothes on, to the bathroom and there was an old bathroom sink. There was a white wall about ten feet up and a little bit of flooring. I thought it was a bathroom, but I didn't want to talk to any one. So I walked in and walked around and looked around a little bit. I looked around and found a large area that used to be a bathroom. I walked over there to see what the old restroom contained. I thought to myself "This has been there before?" I looked around and I started taking pictures and making photos of what happened.A week later I came across a second bathroom in a hotel lobby. It was actually called a toilet. I turned around and saw that it was one big large sink with a sink down, and there were two sinks. I looked around and I saw there was a bathroom up there, in front of my work. I tried to open the side door to the bathroom and to the end there was the white wall. The bathroom in front of my work was covered by a black wall. I came up to the wall and they had been covered with something so that I could see what was there. I told them I didn't want to go out and look at them, I wanted them to clean the sink, but the...
660|I was in a room in the living room of an apartment building where the guy who was the guy who had the room had been shot twice. There was a gun in the room, and it was a black powder, about the size of a tennis ball, so it was kind of in a good position to shoot me from right to left, and he had a gun in the room. He put on a mask to disguise himself when I tried to take him out, and then he gave me a gun, to see if I could take him out.You know what? I did have a gun, too. I don't think he tried to hurt me. But I'm sure he did. He was trying to get the gun to come down. And he turned it on, and it just stopped. I got a gun, and I shot him in the chest. I didn't shoot him, I just shot him in the stomach. That's what happened.Saturn: but you don't know how much of a problem it is. It's an open wound in the back, probably in the middle of the chest.Travis: I saw the guy standing in front of me, with a gun, just like what you could shoot me in. And he had a gun. Like he had a gun, and he put it on the table. And he was like like, "What the heck? What the hell?" And I was lik...
661|I was in college at an art college and was working on some pieces of music. I was talking with a professor who was trying to figure out what he wanted me to do (not me). And I said, 'you don't really know. You're a computer scientist.' He looked at me funny. 'I'm studying architecture.' I was in disbelief. I felt completely lost. Suddenly, the professor was like, 'oh, okay. It's this way. I'm good at teaching, you know?' I'm like, 'you're so right.' And he said, 'then why didn't you think about this?' I said, 'why would you just say my name as a sort of reference to me?''well, because you knew I was the person writing the music. And you know, it's so funny that you did it, just like, 'what?'"This is the kind of music which is popular with the young generation of young people, but the music they can hear today has a very particular meaning and is still very mysterious. This was not the case with the young generation. Young people, being educated about the music, being able to understand it – and that sounds very wrong, it's like, you're not listening to something you've heard for hours or even hours. And I was like, well, no. No! You hear me making these sounds and you understand it.I've always felt that the youn...
662|Just as my brother-in-law was going to come over in the morning and watch me sleep, I noticed when I'd just finished getting off the car, I'd get in his car."He was sitting on the hood, just staring at the sun, and I just looked down and saw it as a white sun. I wasn't sure what to do, but my brother-in-law just said, 'this is where you were.' I went over to him and I said, 'how are you doing? I told you I was going to get your brother-in-law to go to bed. He said he couldn't help it.'"He said, 'i told you I couldn't help it.' It was just an unbelievable coincidence."I said, 'how can you do this?'""He said, 'you can. I told you what to do. I told you I was going to get your brother-in-law to go to bed."I was scared.""Well, I think I know exactly how he was going to tell me to go to bed - I'm sure he was going to see me."We were about to go to bed when the lights went off. So I had to stay in my car."The next thing I know I was sitting on the hood, watching the sun rising, and I was watching my mother's ca...
663|You guys are like, "Oh man, we'll just cut it in. We'll just cut it in." And I don't think people know what that means. The first season is all about that, and I'm looking forward to the second season, and people're talking about it.Do you think there will be more about the game in 2017?When you go through your history, the first five years of it were terrible to me. I'll always go back to the game of football. It's a big part of my identity. It's just, if you lose the game to a team, everybody is gonna be like, "We got this guy." Just a huge part of my identity. I love that game. It's a huge part of the game.Does it feel like an extended season?It feels like a few months.Has the season been great lately?Yeah, i've been getting better. I've been playing football. It's got a lot better, and it's getting better. I've been looking for opportunities. The season has gone up so far, and it's finally going down again. It's gotten better and better.It's been so long.I still play in it. I'm on my way.A lot of the things we get to do in the preseason and at the end of the year, you have a bunch of guys doing thing...
664|I came a minute before the race, just as I was taking pictures. There was a large man with huge hair on his tail outside, which was a big man. He had to hide behind his waistcoat. I told him I was taking pictures of the rally. Then I went outside and he pulled out a gun and started shooting. I thought, what an amazing sight they had. And then he pulled out a gun and started shooting. I was so scared I just shot him in the head. I knew I was going to be shot. It was just a shock. It was terrifying. I was scared that someone might be shot. I thought, I'm going to die. I don't think I'llever be able to believe what I saw the next day."There was a man who was wearing a black shirt, black shoes, with a white shirt. And he was holding a gun. He was shooting at people, at people, at people."I said to him, hey, I'm taking pictures. I'm trying to shoot you. I shot you because I want to get my name out there. It's nothing personal. But I do it because I want to get my name out there. And one of my friends has his name on his passport and he's here in the us and he says, 'my name is dylann storm. I'm from the city of baltimore, maryland. I'm married. My mom's a...
665|i have just discovered a lot about the world of cryptocurrency that I haven't even touched on before. It's a bit of an understated topic.I have to say that i've never been a fan of cryptocurrencies. There's always someone out there who is a crypto fanatic and I am the first person to explain to you why I believe they are wrong.Why do they want to take on all this currency and why do they want to go into it with such a big name and be totally open about it?Let me get this straight. I don't believe that this is a business that needs the support of many people. Not to mention not every company that wants to take our money. It's about having a clear vision that it is a business that needs the support of millions and millions of people.So, I won't be taking this opportunity to get into this.Why don't you buy any kind of bitcoin. How will that benefit you?Well, it's going to help me grow the game and it's going to help my game. I've been doing this for a long time so I really like the game and it is going to help me grow my game.We are not there yet. We are doing this with a bunch of people as you know, our team is growing and you have a lot of people in the room that have some kind of influence with what I am doing. I...
666|One day they got married. The next day after, they get married.The first thing we had to do was to say, "Hi, I'm a lawyer! I am a lawyer, and I'm a lawyer for a client, and I want to know what she has to say. So I'lltell you a story."He said, "I don't feel like I'm in a rush." So I said, "Well, let's talk about that." (laughs.) he said, "I've got to be honest with you, so my story is not going to be a little story to you, but I guess my story will be."So I said, "Well, we've got to figure out a story for you. We've got to tell this guy that she has to tell you something. We have a different story, and we have to tell this guy that she has to tell us something. It's going to be a different story for you."So with that, we knew we wanted to do this in the first place, so we did it.Jeremy chamber: we've seen your work from your other projects like the black swan (1987) and the godfather (1988) and you've written a number of other books for the indie film business. Tell us a little bit about your work as a writer, and when did you start working for the film industry...
667|i think there would be a lot of people who would be upset that you said something about our religion, that we're not really human. They would be mad at your god and your religion.And one of the things that people would say is, "That's what you know. We're good." And they would say, "Sure, that's true of us." But I do believe the whole notion that we're like other humans and that we have an intelligence. And there's a lot of people who see that and think, "Well, god doesn't want you here, so i've got to go to hell."Well, I think it's very important that people understand that they can't talk about their religion without actually having their religion and their faith or their faith. And that's a big challenge in this country. And I think in the last two years, that many people are starting to realize that it's not that simple.Amy goodman: so, I want to take a moment to ask you this: are there people that you'd like me to go to hell for?Andrew lorner: yes, there are.So I want to turn the interview to my book, "A god without you." It should be, and I'm sure many of you have read that book, to hear you say what it is. It is a very good book.We have a lot o...
668|In 1873, before the civil war, james and I were working on a piece of book about civil rights. I went to a conference the other day, and jim and I talked about the civil rights act. The first thing I said was, "Yes," Because I knew the congress was going to do something about it, and I knew I had to do something about this in order to get some traction. I went, "You know what? I don't know. I'm just looking at the facts." So I said, "Don't worry. I'm an educated man. I'm going to learn. I'm going to learn, and I'm going to be able to make a living up there." And so, over three years, I'm working on this.Amy goodman: in december of last year, there was a petition to remove the ban on abortions. And he says, "I've heard that too. Why would you remove this?" So we're speaking from the statehouse.Jim mckay: I'm just here with the book. I mean, we came into this country as an emancipatory movement. I was doing civil rights work, and then, after the election of george mcgovern, I went from civil rights to civil rights.Amy goodman: after the election, in this book, they say, no one, including you, can talk about voting, but you do that. The president of th...
669|It was during the early, early part of the nineties that I felt that it was really important to find, and for the sake of the story, to take the action at the level of our characters who were already there. But the truth is, it was the roleplaying community that I was at that point in my life that gave me the real sense of what an action-action character could be.What i've seen in the last two weeks is that the number of players who have been playing a level, and who are looking for opportunities to play it, has increased. And so, what I think is a good thing is that we're at the level where we can play it on their own, with our friends, and we can have a group of friends come out and play their level and it's all fun. And if someone's saying to me, "Just follow me and I'lltake that person," Well, I can do it. And the other thing that happens is, it grows so fast that it just leaves a lot of people sitting there thinking, "Well, I'lltake that person."In terms of people who have played a level and their friends who've played it, the majority of that will be in north america. What are you doing right now that's going to help people get started, really. What are you going to do to try and bring this in to the world?[laughs] yeah...
670|This morning we were just chatting and I was having a conversation about something I do with a friend and she said, 'hey, you know, let's talk and let's do this.' And I said, 'what the heck?'"He and the other girls in the school's basketball team sat in a chair at the front row and watched video of a game between the two boys.The school officials told fox affiliate wkjr-tv that they don't condone violence that is "Unacceptable" Or "Unacceptable."But they insist that if they want a change in campus atmosphere, their students need to be allowed to participate peacefully."We have to have a certain respect for our students, but we need to be willing to tolerate some kind of violence or some kind of disrespect," Said jordan h. Stover, president of the american academy of pediatrics.Stover is a member of the american academy of pediatrics committee, which monitors and advises doctors on how to treat a growing range of conditions such as cancer, diabetes and other diseases. He said in a statement to fox news that the issue of violence should go unquestioned."It is absolutely not acceptable to put our students in situations where we would be willing to consider the situation in any manner."There are no 'rules' in this situation so they can't intervene. Even the kids that are going there need to understand that there are safety concerns....
671|Last year, for the first time, my brother and I were able to be together on our own time. The family lived together. We were able to come to a meeting where we were able to discuss a lot of things with us. He told my brother that he wants to be with me now. My brother said, 'you mean he wants to be with somebody?"My brother and I went to the airport, and he was talking to an employee who was going to be waiting for us. He said to me, "Oh, I'm afraid I can't go to work for a guy like you." I said, "Wait. Why would you need a guy like you here?" And he said, "I'm gonna help with the logistics for that guy and just go with him where I want. My brother and I went to the airport. There was a lady sitting behind me. She told them how I was having a hard time because she had lost her job. I didn't know what was going on, and she said, 'mom, i've got some girls and they're going to be coming over.' I explained to her my case. She said, 'don't worry, I'm going to get you back in the game, because I don't wanna end up in a situation like this.' I said no, and she said, 'ok, you're here today. Why don't you come out tonight? Tell me where you want to go.'...
672|You came in from hawaii, and you were walking around with your dog, and it's not a great way to go, but it's nice. What did you do with that little dog?[laughs] it was good. And it was just another friend of mine. I said, "Man, come on, we can't have that." He said, "You know what? It would be better to keep your dogs out of trouble, which is why I decided to keep your dog from getting hurt—cause the other dog has been out for seven years and they still don't want to let us go."We saw each other at the beginning of july—where it was cold and snowy, when we were sitting in a car when it was hot. So, we had a little walk together. We got to talking, and by the time this happened, he told me about his great love for his dog.It was one of his favorite spots! It was just so cozy.Was your dog's life in hawaii?No. I mean, we had a great time in hawaii, so I knew there was a lot of good friends there, and I knew he was there. It had been my first time back.I can't say what the relationship was like on the boat. But I remember he was really nice to me. It was like I had been with my dog for years, and now he had ...
673|in 1997, when I was still an elementary school teacher in atlanta, I went to the bus stop of the bus company to pick up the mail. We stopped and asked the customer service representative if we could pick him up to pick up the kids, and he agreed to pick them up. I told them that I was sorry for making the bus stop, but that I'd have him back before I went to pick them up. In fact, he was happy to take them anyway. He just wanted to go to school and go pick them up. When I told them I wouldn't pick them up, he was absolutely shocked to learn that he hadn't been the only one who couldn't.It's funny that our friend who works there told me not to worry about my behavior; I know that she knew. Then, she told me, she felt very, very sorry for them. But what she'd done was she didn't even talk to me about my behavior. Then, a week later I found out the truth. It had been six days since they'd pulled off the bus, and the car was no longer moving. I had my back to the road, my neck hanging a bit, and I was feeling miserable. When I called the local doctor, I wasn't sure where he was. He didn't want to explain it, either.So, I called him back. He was there. He had told me that he didn't understand what ...
674|The day I was in a college class, and I was watching the daily show. One of my roommates at the time, I was in a class and we had some discussion about an article that was coming out of the college library. He said, "What do you mean by 'how many' books do you have in your library?" I said, "Well, I don't have any." He said, "Let's look at 10 books in your library, how many books does that mean to you?" My roommate replied, "How many books are you going to have in your library?" I said, "How often do you have those books, and when will you get them?" He said, "I'm going to have them because my library has a very low literacy rate." My roommate said to me, "You've got a bunch of books on your shelf, do you want to read those?" I said, "Yes. And now I have to read them all. But if you don't have them, I'llfind them in my library. So that's what I call a 'wonderful deal.'" He said he was going to give me a chance on which to buy them, and I said, "That's where I'm going?" He said, "This is how you get to know your libraries. I don't have to read them. I get to read that kind of thing every week and I never have to read 'em down....
675|i'm a teacher from the community of south carolina in the university of south carolina school of law. I graduated in the fall and the summer of 2014. The first of my children began kindergarten at age two, and I knew nothing of the fact that the parents involved. I thought that maybe this was just a way to keep their children safe. As I looked into their minds, I could tell their first words had something to do with something else.One of the things I learned in my time working as a lawyer from my family was that one of the things that has really changed the way I think about child safety is the idea that we want more children to know that there are safe, responsible, and legal professionals in school. I believe children have been taught not to do things that people do, even to children. I believe the most important thing that will have any meaningful impact on how these kids learn is that they learn from it.We have a huge range of opportunities, and in this case it's the school district that's being shown these policies. Schools like ours are not designed to allow kids to be taught to read. It's designed to allow kids to read at their own pace and to develop their own skills.And what's changed in these new policies is that the public has had the ability to judge the way that kids can learn a new course of behavior. If you've got a question you want answered, you can ask a teacher...
676|This was my first time doing research in the world of social networking. I discovered that when people post photos, they often think about what's going on, and they have no idea what's going on other than social networking sites. So, you know, I'm just trying to be a good friend to people that do social networking…and that's sort of where you're able to connect really well, not just as an individual, but as a company which you can make money from and I'm just glad that you brought this to my attention. I'm just trying to be in this position where people can connect to me and I can be part of the community. It happens to be a good feeling right?I'm just proud of how much my efforts and my network has made me really well-connected. I'm just proud of my work as a company, I just can't wait to share it with people who might not be able to hear it. I'm not here to take selfies, I'm here to show someone that it's there, and I'm not going to take pictures. I just want people who are looking for something to connect. So, it's just great that it's like, 'hey, there's a little project out there that I can help you with. How about you help me make money by taking a picture of something or a quote from your favorite website?' So, we can really make a difference here – and also, ...
677|Every time I get a new email from your company in india, I just ask: "How do you feel about this?" I reply: "I am glad you asked." I get a few compliments and then a few email messages. I like that.It's the only way I can tell you how happy my job is.I was once a huge salesman at facebook. A friend gave me a small business phone and the one I kept at my house for the last 20 years. I took that to facebook which turned me into a great person and a big deal. The next day I told other people like this. I went and showed them the business phone and they didn't like it. They didn't like the idea of selling on them.For a while I wanted to buy a business phone and I thought it would be great, not only for my own business but for the family because they were my friends and so I could use them in my business. And they agreed so I went to facebook to find them.I wanted to buy a business phone from facebook and from where? The place. I called for a minute and the man was like: "Hello, are you there? I have a business phone for you so why not check your mobile number and I will get you a copy."Then he asked me if I wanted to buy an iphone 6 and I said yes. He did not know that I was in india, and thi...
678|when you were young, there were two great presidents. They each had four sons for two generations. One was a lawyer, but the other, a secretary. When I was twenty, we had two presidents, one was a professor of law and the other a lawyer. I was one of them, so I was quite good on the side of my daughter, and my daughter's father's law did not want me to apply to harvard, so he asked me not to apply but to become a professor. He said, "When you do this, you might be a yale professor. But I have a feeling that no one will take me because I have been in harvard too long." Well, that's not true.I think this is the part where there are some differences between me, from both sides of an argument and I feel that the problem is something that is not solved.One of them was that I have a deep connection with a lot of people in the law profession as well. This was actually one of the things that was really difficult because I don't get to take my teaching with me. At first, the professors would talk in good language about how I was a scholar and this was then, but I had been teaching law for about five years before that. I thought the professor, he should be the best teacher in the world. I remember a couple of years ago, when I was teaching a class about what the average american law student does an...

680|In 1983, I was just a little boy. My father was a lawyer. My mother was a teacher. The two of us lived in a small little house in a town on the mississippi river. The town was a place where there were few white people left and there was no one black. We were only four years old, just like my father is. We walked along a creek and on our way out of this village we came across a big white man. It was going nowhere. That night we went to school because his car suddenly stopped running and he was dead. My father was driving away from school. So he came home and there was no sign of him again. It was four years later when I met my father-in-law and he gave me all of the details about what happened.We walked back to the road. We went to camp. We got ready to go to church, but my father had to come home early to finish work. He and I went out to a village where I lived, and I found my grandfather, who was also a lawyer. I was very scared. My mother died after she was shot. She was not home for a year. I called the police, told the police that the police had arrested my father, and they were going to arrest the family for the death of my mother.The police arrested my grandfather and my father for the killing. When they did so, they found my grandfather and told him to b...
681|One night I was drinking with my friends at a party. I was getting ready for school. I was about to get out when, as I was about to finish my sentence at school, a loud, heavy, boisterous voice came by and told me that someone had killed my friend. I turned on the light and saw my friends standing outside of the house. I ran up for my life. I saw a person. I thought it was one of my friends, but I didn't know what. I went to his apartment. I ran to the bedroom. I saw my friend's body. I saw my friend's hand moving. I knew they had been hit in the head, or possibly even their body. I got a call back from his girlfriend, who was out in the kitchen. I heard her screaming for help. I ran into the hallway. A scream had been heard from her. The door was slammed shut and then the guy who was in the kitchen, who was standing in the doorway, opened it and found his friend's body. The victim had been strangled and he had been stabbed multiple times in the chest. When they came in the street, I saw that my friend had been stabbed. I ran back upstairs, and found him lying in a corner of the house with his back to the other side of the alley. I was able to reach him and told him he had to get to the hospital. I called my friend and he said he had to com...
682|You see there was a couple of different children that were all under the age of 10. And we don't know what they were eating. And we didn't know how long they were going to be there. And we didn't know why or how long they were going to be there. And just the next day when they were back in school or in a parent's office, there was this white guy at his desk in a wheelchair who'd gotten a paper out and was like "I don't know what you just ate that's for breakfast, it's not for lunch."And at that point, of course, you know, this white guy says, "What's up?" And you're like, "Well, it's because of that." And they're like, "No, you're eating food that's high in fat." They know very well that that's not what they're trying to be.Well, there's no one like hillary clinton or donald trump making the case. They're not making any of those cases.They're just being told by their own advisers that there is an alternative path to the white house, and I was thinking, "Well, what about that?"And then there are people coming into this campaign that are saying, "If these people want an alternative, I will tell them to wait until donald trump does what he says he is capable of."No, I'm kidding...
683|I think that you are right about that.This week, I was working at a high school with my best friend, a girl and three kids that are all in kindergarten. We were talking about a game: one of five "Champions" For every 1,000 participants. I was having our friend walk into the room with her kids and show them what the top team in the tournament was all about. I took her word for it, she started to talk about the games I played against me, and she immediately told me that I had a lot to study. I didn't know what to do. I was so busy practicing, I didn't even know what I was supposed to do. I didn't know how to make the most out of my experience that night, and I was so afraid that I had no time left. It was like going on a trip. What do you do when you see what other people have done, or how do you cope?When you go the distance from a game to an event, you start to think that maybe there are no problems. There are no distractions. Even if you're not in charge of the event, your responsibility is to make sure everyone is happy. You're not in control of who is playing who, you have no control over how long it takes in the tournament, and you don't have the time or energy to do it all.In fact, if you just try for th...
684|My father used to tell stories like this all the time. I was growing up in rural, rural vermont. I don't even care what people call the place, the family, and they call it the house. So I used to tell stories of how my little brother was getting a job and when he got a call from his mom, he came to my mom and told her about the things she did for him. And then my mom took him out and got a job when my dad was eight years old. My father was really sick, but he was able to find a little bit less pain in the pain. Because my father still had to work, he didn't have to take my dad out and get me to college. And my dad was doing so well after getting a new job.It just took him a little while to get used to it. But my father just started doing very well. I remember one day, when I was three years old, my dad came to his house for a job interview and asked if we could go out. And my dad just said, "No, of course, that was for the money." But my mom told him, all I had to do was get this $20 to go out. And to that day, it was all for the money.That's really cool, that's what it was all about because for everyone here, it was great. Not just that it was fun, but you could sit here wit...

687|We were married at nineteen, and we were married to the most experienced, most talented, most competent man I have ever known, and a woman with an exceptional personality. She had a very beautiful mind. I remember thinking to myself, "I really want to do this. If only I could be this good. I want to be the best man in the world.I want to have an advantage."We spent a wonderful week. In the hospital, I saw a patient. We shared towels and towels and towels and towels.But we were getting sick of everything. We ate. We slept. We smoked. We drank coffee. We just needed a few minutes each day to get back on the right track. Then I took my time. I came up with a simple plan. I said, "These three can't do this. We want to get them out of there as quickly as possible to allow these three to stay in there for a long period of time." And we all agreed to it.It would be easier if we all started at a certain age. And then we would look at each other and say, "I want to get rid of one of them and give that to that other one."And then I'lltell you one. First, we went to bed at eleven o'clock. I said, "I want to start on this three."The next morning, we wer...
688|The story you have got here, the story you have got at the top of the charts, is pretty much a tale of two men that I have seen a lot of, and a man that I know, and a man that I know very well, and a man that I know from experience, but I'm not going to give you one, and I'm not going to give you the whole story of this great men and this great business thing that he was one of, and one day you got to take a piece of that piece of paper and write a story about it. That's all.I had to go down and take that piece of paper. That's all. I was in a rush last night and thought I'd put up an article about it. So i've got a piece of paper in the back. It's a story. It's a story about the guy who was doing the business and what he was doing. And I was like, 'it's all right if you do it and you get your money, but we haven't got a story about that to tell you.' It's a very powerful story, and it's been a big story all year long.So what are you doing at this point that's really important to me and to you?So to start, I'lltell you what I'm doing. I'll tell you what i've found in my life. It's not that I am a bad guy...
689|I was living in a small town because my neighbors just left. I don't know where they ended up. The only time you ever see them is when the car leaves. There was a family. It was a family who were the best friends. The only time I ever have a lot of friends I don't know where they ended up. So I think the best story I can tell is that they had a great life.But when you look back and see that they just left you, you realize how much they helped you, how much they really helped you.Toms: what was the best thing you could do to help my family so you know something that happened to them?Schieffer: well, if I could offer some suggestions on some things you could do to help my family.So I just wanted to tell you that my family did everything that they could to take care of it, and then I wanted to tell you a bunch of things that I had to do to help my family.Toms: that's an easy one. I'd get you a whole article about the "Good" Family people and just say that their work was hard, that they brought home people, but on top of that, they needed you to stay in a state of good health and be healthy. They were always on the phone. Every day. They called me at 9 p.M., they texted me at 10 ...
690|What happened? We came to a point where we got in touch with all of our best friends and we went in together. I was a pretty serious guy and I really liked those guys. At the time we got together, it was just me and my dad, and it was fun, because we both have very similar personalities. And I said to myself, "Oh, and did you know that I love watching guys do it and make fun of each other." When guys like that do it, it's a thrill—not so much when they're doing it from a distance. But it's fun to realize that sometimes it's just one person doing it for a very short time." And that's what I did. So it's been really nice growing up, just realizing that there are two different types of people who really love to do it—one who loves to do it over a long period of time, and the other who just doesn't care about it in the slightest, so to speak. And so from that I started to see how I could change. I just started to look at things differently. And, in a lot of ways this is what I wanted to accomplish. So I came out of the school and went to college. And I got my doctorate, I got my bachelor's degree, and my internship went from then on to my ph.D., and then I got my ph.D. In college, I started to get all the opportunities that I neede...
691|My family has been here all these times. Our grandparents were coming home from school when I was 6 years old and my grandfather was coming home from kindergarten at 16. They had been here all these years. We remember sitting in a big-box store in an old school townhouse. This is my family. We had nothing. They were just standing there with their hands in their pockets. No one could even remember what the words were. They could never tell us what, what they did not know. They didn't understand that we had been here all these years and they were in this little house. We were sitting there in a big-box store and the windows were all rolled up and closed. We didn't even understand how we were there. They didn't care about us. He was just sitting there with his hands in his pockets and no one could even even recall what they just did not know. They knew something, so they were angry. But when they didn't know, they just walked straight into the house and they were upset because they knew we were in the house today, they didn't even know. I remember walking into an old-school grocery store and I had forgotten the words that I just heard when I saw them. They walked out of the store and they went to their car. Then you look at me today and you realize, you could have used your hands in this store, but you know you couldn't. You know. You could have seen those word...

693|I am the only person in the world who is aware of that kind of thing, and I have to explain it to everybody. It's all about the facts, not about the lies. It's about the fact that it happened, and I don't care if it is true or not, there are all kinds of things that you can do about it and you can't do anything about it.But then of course one thing has to do with your choice, and I don't think there's a whole lot of people who can do that if you don't care about it. I'm just saying this about my dad—every single little matter that I think of, whether I agree with the facts or not, I don't care. They all happen, but people who don't agree with things that I think are lies, or whether or not they are liars, whatever, all happen if somebody's lying to me. I would never lie to you if I didn't care if you would believe me. But the only way you can go about it is if you have all the facts out there.Amy goodman: well, let's talk about bill clinton's wife, chelsea, that wasn't actually her first wife. She's no, actually, she was—she wasn't her first wife at all, but she was a mother, but that's why she's here. She was my mother, so why has there been an indictment against her for being ...
694|In 2004, when I was a graduate student at the university of california, berkeley, studying computer science, I became interested in the problems of network management. The problem here was that, at least in theory, all the information it could store in the form of a "Cloud" Was in one place. With an internet connection, it was as easy as clicking on the link in a web browser. For a lot of people, I was told, the problem was that the network was constantly shifting.I'm an early adopter of this concept. In 2011, I was the keynote speaker at the european association for network technology conference on network management in budapest, hungary. It was a big conference, and I got a lot of questions from some of the attendees. One man asked how this thing could be used for any type of information. I told him the way something like that can be implemented. He wanted to understand what would happen if I said yes.This was a very interesting point. It's like, "No, no. It's fine." It's like, "You're not going to say yes to anything if you're not going to say no to anything. What's your limit? What's your limit? What's your limit?"So I said to him, "Alright. I can imagine you saying yes to anything. It's ok to do this because it might change your life if you do it." And he said, "Yeah....
695|I was 16 and my sister was 12 at the time. I went upstairs with my mom and dad and we didn't have a car, so I walked upstairs because I always hated running away from home and having my things. My mom would say you're supposed to be running away for your life because you're the one who's going to break in and steal everything. So I went in one day and I ran into her mother and she thought I was running. I said, 'i ran away from home because you're the one who's going to get everything.' She said, 'no, I'm not running away from home because I do your shopping.' And I was like, 'no, this is how it is.' And she said I was trying to steal money and then, you know, she came right down and told me I needed to do this to show that I was a criminal, you know, because I had done something bad. I'd taken money for her and my sister. And I had never done anything bad in my life. I was running my life the right way. And my whole life.Amy goodman: you've said that you're not a criminal. You're married to a woman. You live in a home with you two. How do you define a real criminal?Robert becklett: this is my wife. I don't see the difference here, obviously. I think it's not a question of la...
696|I was a kid when it happened. I'd come home and my sister was on the phone with the guy that was walking around. She was talking to a friend that was trying to make some kind of money, and he was like, "Do you think you can make a living from it?" So, she's like, "Um, yeah. I'd like to take a job as a salesperson to make some money." So I was like, "I need to do some kind of work and maybe it would make a difference." So, I went through, like, 2 or 3 other business models i've tried for years. Because when you talk to people and they come up to you with the idea of taking a job as a salesperson, you think they're a little confused. But it's all really simple, because it's very easy to get a job at one company and to get a business or service and it's so easy to get something on a daily basis that's going to be a nice investment in your life.A friend of mine, in a couple months, I got a job at a local grocery store that ran on the grocery store business model. I was really impressed with the fact that it was very common for people to walk to a store and sit down and buy their food. I ended up buying everything at $9.99, and I thought it was really, really good. But then I was in grad school whe...
697|I used to live in south africa, but when I was in america, I used to go to the south pole. I was a very poor child, and I was going to spend time there for the rest of my life, because I was going to give up all my money and all the things I loved and stuff like that. I started talking to the other kids about it, and there was this beautiful kid in nigeria: he's a great guy, he's a good guy, he's an african kid. I was like, "Yo, man, that's a story!" This kid said, "Yo, man, that's a story! He's an african kid!" And I said, "Yo, man, man, man!" And he was like, "Yo, man, man! That's a story!" And I thought, "It's pretty amazing," And then I started to go and read about it.Do you remember talking to this kid about it?He was like, "Yo, man, man, man, man, man!" And I came back and said, "You can make a really good story about this kid, man." And he was like, "What story?" And I said, "Yeah, man, man, man." And he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah! That's a good story. That's a good story!"He said, "Okay. You can make a really goo...
698|I have two students who were in charge of a classroom. They were being paid by the school. The teacher said, 'hey, we're not gonna make you pay anything, but we want you to pay some money to us.' And one of those kids said, 'you know what? I was going to ask, 'what about you?' And the first guy said: 'i don't know.' And he asked: 'do you work for anybody on the payroll?' And he said "Don't you work here." And then he said: 'you know what? You just tell me, 'do you work for what?' My teacher says, 'no, your teacher said: 'you work for what.'"It took me for an hour, and then I got out of there and started doing something else. I did some research. I was doing the last two episodes of my little pony. It was during this time that I noticed I was doing some things the wrong way.People are having this issue with the amount of money being paid to students in our school. It's hard to be open about money. We have a very specific curriculum that requires kids be paid. Sometimes a kid's salary is very rich, sometimes it's less. We are paying people a lot of money. If you think about it, those who work at the school will be paid. We have a special room where people can't be there to help students.We hav...
699|When I worked for cbs in the 1990s, I was on the executive producer of the night shift, where you could see the show. The first thing you saw was "The night shift," A show that was doing great. And I was just so amazed by the breadth of what it had to offer.There were so many fantastic people. Some of them would say, 'oh my god, this is crazy!' I was like, 'wow! I thought it was going to be like this for a while, but then one day it was like what?' There's so many great people in television right now. And I don't know if they're on the same level.We were on the show for 10 years and they didn't know about it. And I think it was really fascinating for us because they hadn't even heard about it. They thought it was crazy. And they weren't that into it at all. It was a very cool show. And I was really proud to be on it. I don't know what they thought of us.Do you think you ever heard about the night shift, even though it wasn't on network tv.I don't think it ever went into the air. It wasn't on abc. I don't know if that mattered much. I don't think anybody thought it would go on cable. What I remember was the show was a show that I did on abc, and I was always jus...
700|When we came to the church, my husband was not here to tell us all about the church, but about me as I was. And even though I was in a church for a very long time, it was clear to me that I needed to be there to listen to these people. So I left the congregation and went to my local church.I had never before encountered an adult man who would make a life for a young boy outside of the congregation, especially as it was an established church. I was never in contact with a male member of the church, but it struck me how little time they were spending with him. How much time they were going to spend with children. How much time he was spending with the congregation.And so I felt I had had something in common with other men. The church didn't have to do this. I was never in contact with anyone who would act in that way.I had been to the church before, but I never saw a single adult man or a woman who cared about other issues with the church. They didn't even care about children, nor about my husband. I was merely talking to others.We were going to be here for about a week.We couldn't bring our children or even our grandkids. We had no food. We couldn't even have our children play outside. My husband came to tell me about his church and his family, and they kept asking what time o...
701|the first thing I did was take a phone call from my husband.He was about to leave a restaurant and call his daughter. I knew he wasn't home. I didn't tell him the name. I just left his phone and told him to call us.It was over before I could get home to tell him I was going to go and talk to my dad. He wouldn't call until I told him I had not been a bad guy. He said "I know. I was wrong about everything you said, but you're not the only guy who doesn't go in public anymore. This is the first of many bad things you've been saying about me. I don't know what to do now but please call me now."I was so angry at everyone at school and about myself. I told my mom I didn't know her and she told me it was my fault no one ever came out and told me not to tell anyone, even my friends.She said "He doesn't want to hear that your daughter has made all this noise. Please just call me you little boy, I'm not afraid of anything. I know you really are not afraid of me. Please just say that we're going to hear from you. I'll give you my money, I know you're going to have a good week."This was a big, big deal to me. I said, "You're not scared....
702|You know, we all talk about how much we like a good diet. Well, there's really no such thing as a good diet. In the end, people do not make the most of it, but that means they have a higher risk of dying from heart disease and diabetes in high-income countries.Nowadays, if you think about this diet, you've probably noticed that we have high-fat diets for breakfast, lunch and dinner: one-quarter of the diet is carbohydrate, and there's even more fat in the breakfast portions. In europe, we've seen this in the 1950s and 1960s; in the 1960s and 1970s there were even more restrictions than there are now. We had to do more of the same things, but it was really only when I started thinking about what we could do more of—like, what can we do more of?Now, in many ways, the way we're going to try to make sure we've done our part is to make it so that people don't starve. The way we're going to try to do that is by giving them something to eat and then giving them a special dessert. If you want to go a week on a high fat diet, you've got to be super-frugal, or you've got to be a better doctor or a better dietician because you don't have to worry about the calories anymore....
703|my stepmother used to be a nurse on maternity leave, and she and I drove from my hometown to work every day. I started out on a regular basis, but I was able to get paid a certain amount based on my past experience. The first two years before I was laid off took me over 40 hours a week, and by then, my family was starting to move in. The first part of the job was getting paid more easily by employers than by me.Then as we were moving in, we were told there was no way to do anything about any of our unpaid work. The next year, we found out that there were no employees willing to do any of this work, and we were told to cancel or change jobs.I could hardly believe it.One day, I got a call from my family. They had just gotten married and I was in my 20s. No one I knew was really interested in me because they said they'd see me during the day. I had started seeing doctors. I asked my mother why she didn't want me to bring some food to work and she told me I couldn't. I said I did, but I didn't want to have to go to the hospital anymore.I told her that I didn't want to go to the hospital anymore and that if she didn't want me to go, I'd talk to her.

704|In 1997 my friends are at a dinner party in a trendy neighborhood in new york city. They have a story about the movie "The night of the dog." A man comes to the table and tells his friend, "I want the movie tonight. It is a great movie, but its not about a dog." The man says to the gentleman, "Your dog's a dog for real." The gentleman replies, "What are you talking about?" The gentleman replied, "The dog's a dog for real." "What are you talking about?" The man asked. I said, "What do you mean?" "You're talking about this movie," I replied. The gentleman said, "Why didn't I get it? Where'd you get it?" The gentleman said, "We couldn't get it because we didn't know who it was. A dog was meant to give you a message. This is what's going to happen. You see a movie about a dog." I said, "Do you know who this dog is? That's what we saw in 'the night of the dog,'" And I said, "Yes." "What do you mean?" I said, "What do you mean when you say 'the dog'?" I said, "That's what you meant in 'the night of the dog.'" "What do you mean when you say 'the dog'?" You said 'the dog'? You're not even sure where it goes from here. You jus...
705|I was 18 years old in 1988. I was in my mid-teens, so I had just graduated from mit. My mother had just graduated from harvard, and my grandmother was living in massachusetts. I went to a boarding school in boston. My mother and my father worked in an art store and they were starting to do some things. My mom and dad were running a business and my mom was making my living. I went home, so I was like, "Where can I go?" And they came home and we talked about life in the world. The fact that they lived in vermont and they had lived there for thirty or forty years showed to me that they knew what it was like to grow up here. So I went to a boarding school and I was there and I started talking with them and they said that I was going to have to give up my dreams and my dreams, and then I was at my place in new hampshire, where I was a sophomore, and the first day there I was in the classroom and there was a sign, and then, I started talking, and this sign was going, "Dude, what are you doing here?" I said, "I want to go to class, and I want to go to class and I want to go to class." They knew that my father had been in college in the '90's and he was graduating and he took his first class. That really put me on to class. I went out on ...
706|I remember when I was about 15 or 16 or 17, we were all sitting around a club talking about what was going on around the football team and how we needed to get used to it. The stadium was filled with these kids playing in the front row and they'd just been playing at that age and we'd seen them playing. So that would be the day that people would get used to it and we'd get used to it and we'd get used to it and we'd be so proud of what we'd seen and what we'd seen. But, the game wasn't that simple, so much of the game it just needed to be played properly.And that's why I'm here with the football girl. She's been making music for over 10 years now and I think people have never been able to get better at the game of football. I wanted the football girl because I wanted everybody to know what she was doing, what she was doing on the field, what she was doing on the field like the kids were doing in the stadium, and what she stood for during the game. She just wanted to help out. And she did. She was really good at that and really did the little things that were needed most during the game, such as bringing us into the game while we were out of the game, as well as doing her own character.And when you're playing a game like that, you're going to make mistakes. And the mistakes tha...
707|this is a story of two brothers who have no intention of killing each other. No one was ever going to put them against each other. And that's just like what happened to my father. Because my father had been a bad man. His uncle was a bad man who shot my father in the forehead. And he killed many kids. But he was the one who took care of them; he was a real good person. And there was some trouble about him. But people were always complaining about things. But they had my father's best intentions. So I went and got married, got married and had children.So now this is the first time I have ever heard of my father. I don't know how my dad got the job. What did he do if he got killed? What was the matter? I just hope he died in the name of my father's son, because it's so hard to tell.Well, there's something else I want to say. I'm sorry.I'm sorry.You know, I'm not asking any questions. That's just because I'm so young. I'm not trying to keep you from that.Thank you.Well thank you for coming on.-- this question is being presented at the eventthank you.It wasn't any different.(end videotape)chicago, feb. ...
708|I'm a former navy seal and a retired army general who went undercover as a journalist to cover up a major crime. I was covering the war on terror. And I think there are a lot of people that feel that that was a cover-up because you're so often wrong.You know, I think in the case of osama bin laden we got to do what the government did not want our government to do—do what would have happened if we didn't have the cia, and I think we did. And the truth was, we were wrong. And there is a big difference here between our government and the people involved. We lost because of our government.So when you go down the path of trying to get a warrant for a phone call from osama bin laden, you're going to be very, very disappointed. And when you say, I'm going to go to the white house, and you're going to take me to the white house, you're going to be very disappointed. You're going to be very, very upset.And I think this is why I always say it happens when you're on one of these media projects and you're so in the news all throughout the world. What you're going to see in the end is that it's going to be hard for you. But I think that you're going to see people who believe that they can get some sort of immunity. So, I don't think you're going t...
709|i have been working as a bartender of nearly two years. I am not much of a dancer, but I do have some of the best pictures of a woman. For the past two weeks, I have been working in front of a live audience on a couple venues, performing in front of a roomful of professional dancers. I have been looking forward to this experience. If you want a good night out, get out of here and find a good spot. Maybe you won't find a bartender. Or maybe you won't.Do you enjoy being a dancer? What makes you want to come out of the shadows and put your talents on display? And what do you hope their performances will tell you...
710|Some of the people in the world who know my name are friends with the clintons. So many of these people have ties in their own family business. But they have no connection to the clintons. And because they don't have anything to do with our campaign, they are never gonna have any money on their side.Amy goodman: so what exactly are the people in the crowd trying to do?Mary daniel: well, the fact is that these people have been working for so long, at a very high level, that they have no idea what's going to happen during the election. And, you know, some of them have been trying to get the democrats to give amnesty to millions of illegal aliens and to bring back all of the jobs that were lost. And others have taken advantage of our tax cuts to help them pay for their own campaign, and other people have been giving speeches at every stage of the campaign to show them who won. There are a number of folks in this crowd who are getting paid to do the work of the clintons, and others who want to get the money back. But we are being watched. I mean, we do have people in different parts of the country like that that want to do work for the clintons. Some of the other people who come down the hall with me are doing things in favor of the democrats, and some of them are supporting the democrats, but most of these people are sitting over here doing nothing. An...

712|i am a black man in the 80s. At 21 I was in my 50s when I was first asked what I wanted to do professionally for a living. I was an entrepreneur. I was the one who founded an equity fund with my friends, a company called capital insight venture management. Then over time my work was moved from the home office to the global office. I worked as an employee agent and then spent the next seven years doing marketing for companies like facebook, twitter and apple. I've worked with the cia, the fbi and other intelligence agencies to build a team of black people and i've been able to make millions of dollars in a few years.I don't believe you can't have a relationship with a black person. If you are a person of color, you have to have some of the tools we all need to have a relationship with one another and i've noticed that a lot of organizations that are trying to start black marriages aren't looking for black applicants because they are a minority in their community, black people.If you just want to make a name for yourself then you have to have some self-esteem and be a good person. If you don't have self-esteem in the 90s you don't have your self-identification. So I don't know, I can't tell you how many times I was told to be like that, just that. When I saw that in the media it was so shocking. Whe...
713|The second we talk, there is a lot of chatter about what was going on. We hear about the fact that he was getting arrested in new orleans a week or two back, and I said, ok, if what he's saying is true, then I'm going to talk about what happened in new orleans. We've just heard a lot more about the way he's handled it and how little he understands about what happened. We've heard of him trying to figure things out and trying to come along and say, hey, I'm still here, and I understand some things, but it just took a while.Amy goodman: I want to talk about alonzo mourning, who came forward with his report earlier this year in the los angeles times. He's seen it many times in the news, in some newspapers. And what did you find? Well, you know, he was a young man who had just moved to new orleans and was working with the city's police department. And he says that he was a victim of an ambush by fellow officers. And as you say, your work ethic led him to go forward with his investigation. But you also know, there was one more thing he said that I think that's very important to note, which is that the fact that he's here in new orleans does not mean that what happened to you or that you're not going to be charged. That's what we've found. We have evidence of that, an...
714|When we were playing the game, one of the players came downstairs and told us the names of the game's three main characters. The first one was the villain, the villain's name was eriana karkarova. But then they said, "He's only a criminal, and he's a murderer. We need a character like that for the game."After he played the game, I did my version of the first one. That's when a friend suggested, "What happened here is it's one of those things where in any game, if all three players are evil guys, then we should be fighting them." And so, of course, eriana got into the game. But it's interesting when anyone asks who is good and who is bad and then asks who is good and who is bad and then says, "You know what, all three, you're evil characters." That was my first game.Amy goodman: this is democracy now!, democracynow.Org, the war and peace report. I'm amy goodman, with juan francisco gómez. I'm with juan francisco gómez, who joined us in miami, and we'll be back in a minute. It's on our website. Stay with us...
715|For eight years, the world was in a state of mourning. I was in the middle of a war against isis, and we were in an armed conflict to protect ourselves. Isis was responsible for many of the atrocities that were reported, and it was an absolutely vicious conflict that resulted in many deaths."He continued: "I think we need to take stock of the fact that, at the time, isis was a very small group of terrorists in iraq, and the u.S. Forces at the time had no choice but to make a stand. And that was the end of it, as many people would agree. Isis would not only become a bigger and more dangerous group, but it would also gain the support of some of the people who supported them. And that's where we need to look for the most effective way to combat isis, which is a very different military capability that is focused on supporting the iraqi people.""As we see that a lot of the terrorists on the ground are from the region that has been engaged in the war, we can look at the u.S. Airstrikes on isis as a way to provide a counterbalance to the fighting that isis has done in iraq and across the world, and then we can look at the u.S. Involvement in the war in syria as something that can be used to help isis in syria, so that we can see the kind of capabilities that isis has to take on the battlefield with the u.S...
716|My mother was once a young woman who was just sixteen. When I was seventeen she moved in with her uncle and her grandmother, and we moved to the old house. They didn't have time to move in with her when she first went, but she was never left alone, so she moved in every single night until I was quite old enough to see her often. She was in a comfortable house and we always made sure to go back and look for her. I think I was sixteen when she moved in with me. When I was nineteen she moved in with her mother and she took me to the old house with her. But she never left her own home, so I always had a little friend who came and picked up a boy and then went to my aunt's to come back later for some supper and we went back on business. It is true that I went to school for years, but it seemed to me that the only way for me to survive was to go to school. It was very difficult, and that was because I never had anything to eat for two or three days before I got my brother to go back to school. I tried to stay strong but I was afraid that the boy would lose his strength and he would fall into the abyss and I would fall into the abyss again. We always went back to school the whole year and it was all just very hard. I didn't feel safe, but I was the little boy. When I moved out of my aunt'...
717|They were very impressed with me. It was a very nice experience.I guess, I guess to me I was like "I could really just walk into this place with nothing and walk all the way in to the place?" (laughs) so, I started to feel like I'm in my own world, I couldn't stay here without some sort of money. I mean, I was in my own world in my twenties, I was making millions and millions of dollars.I didn't see a lot of people who were going through this, that was all I saw. It was like, I don't know what this is. I'm just in my own thing. This is my world.So, to your point, the things you think are interesting to you from your perspective are really the things that really make you happy.Yeah, yeah! Well, I think it's sort of how I go about my daily life. I think, for some reason, the only other people that were actually engaged in it were myself, but yeah, I think that was the most interesting thing.You know, I'm the only guy that did all the other stuff that I do.A lot of people think that I was the only person that did it. (laughs) because I started out at nyu just like everybody else.And I started at nyu just like everybody else. Like I didn't know anything about it...
718|I have been working on a project that has not been done so far. During my youth, my parents were a very poor family, and they were very close with a lot of young girls. Every year on the day I went to school and when I was little they gave me so much money that I started to live in a very small and quiet place. Now, even though it was my first experience, I have never met anything like this. As I was looking for places to live with my parents, I came across a small and quiet place where my parents were. I have never met anyone that was poor as much as I was. It was beautiful. In the old days, they had to pay for it, but I never met anyone that was poor. Today, this place is so quiet and peaceful. The children have started to enjoy the world around them, and people like them. I feel very lucky to be able to share this love with them.The only other thing I have learned is that my father is a pretty rich man and so we are fortunate enough to have a lot of friends. We would go on a day trip to a country park and meet some kids. We would drive all the way to the park and meet people and go to the park for dinner. We would go to the park and say hello and then go for dinner. Then we would go back to the park and say hello again and then go back to the park. Every day for ...

720|We used to sleep in our car and sometimes we'd go to the gym together and we would go to the gym together. At home, we would watch football together and it was great for us to get together and hang out and play together. I remember my dad would look at me and say 'oh man, you look pretty tough, just how tough you are.' He just wasn't happy at all. He said 'well you're not going to be able to sleep with your legs because you're too big.' I'll say it was because he thought it was a big deal, because for me he was really into football because he was worried about me and I was worried about him and i've always wanted to play football. I want to play football because I love playing football and it's not my place to dictate what the referee has to do.He made good arguments in front of the other players, but we've got to remember that he just didn't want to be with us. He wanted to play football. This was the moment we all know why. He would get up and then he'd go 'get in the car,' and he'd come into the game again to play. He was so desperate.He said as he looked down on me for a second, 'why wasn't you doing this?' I said 'i was just trying to give him the best football that I could get.' He said 'but now you're just trying to make th...
721|We were having a meeting in the middle of the night, and the president of the walt disney company came on stage, and when I looked up to see donald at the end, he looked up and he looked up and he looked down at me and said, "Well, you know what. He is going to come out of his hotel room. He is going to be your friend." And I said, "Well, I can't do that. He is going to come out of his room. He is going to be your friend. I want you to know that." And I was like, "But, mr. President, I am just telling you what. I am going to put his name and his name, and I am going to put his family name and his family name, and he will come out of his hotel room." And I went. I went back and, you know, I said, "But, mr. President, I am going to put his name and his name, and I am going to put his family name, and I am going to put his family name, and he will come out of his hotel room." And I said, "Well, mr.

722|you may have heard of the 'bully' that bullies you. They are just like you. They can be obnoxious and mean to you, but if you aren't careful, it can get very, very nasty, especially if you've been abused. You might think you're not being bullied at all, because it's a pretty big deal, but you're far too weak to be bullied, and if you don't want to, you're going to have to make an effort.Sometimes you have to make an account to get the person you want to hurt, and sometimes it's only a matter of time before their behavior starts to change. The good news is, you won't have to stop, as long as you know what to do, which they know. If your anger can only be used to hurt somebody else, you're a hero, even if that person is not a bully.If you have been told you have to be the hero because you are a bully, you can still change your mind. If you are going to become the hero, you need to understand what's wrong with you, and that you're the one being hurt. When that is happening, you could also make a difference.When you think about it, I know many people have been bullied over the years, but I can tell you it's not one of my fault. I've only been in the office at least 2 times, and every time I wa...

724|The first time I tried to buy these shoes was in the summer. My parents were giving me a discount of $50 to buy them when I stopped my shoes to wear their clothes. They said you get them in the best condition, but not at the cost of $500 of shoes. Well, I thought it was fair. When I tried wearing these shoes again I went back to shopping. So I took them to the nearest dollar general and bought them. I bought some of them so I could put them into the trunk of my house so I could walk around that beach and I could have them. I put these back in the trunk, and my son and I had it in the trunk, and he brought it in and we left it at home. I'm glad I did, because it has been so much fun to get my shoes back. It's really been such a fun experience to wear my new shoes. I am really pleased with the quality, great prices, and great customer service.I wish I had bought these from my mom more than once because they were so good. I'm not sure if I would go back and change them. It's all about the quality, the quality of the shoes, and how comfortable they are to wear. My daughter just loves them and they were easy to put on. I can't recommend enough of these shoes. They're really nice shoes to be able to wear to work.They were really soft. They were reall...
725|And I'm not just saying this because I know that it won't win you over. It will certainly make things worse for you—not easier. I'm just saying it because it will make things more difficult.On tuesday, you discussed your feelings for the man who died in a fire at the home of your ex-fiancee, and he suggested that your wife is not her husband's "Favorite" Wife: "She's not perfect, but she's never been too busy with her stuff to look after her family."Do you even know what you're talking about?I'm not, as i've said before.On one hand, he is a hard guy to look at. That said, don't get me wrong—i don't dislike him. I just don't think he has to look to make sure there's a balance. I don't think there's, like, any perfect relationship or anything. What I do have in common with him are two traits: one, that's about as important as anything. Two, the way he's dealt with it, it just doesn't feel right. He's a man who makes mistakes, has a sense of humor and has a way with people, and that's going to work out very well.Then, a few weeks ago, you had a big conversation with him, and you said things like, "My wife and i're in love," Which was a ver...
726|We were both very nervous. And there were other things we were worried about. I'm sorry for you. In a way, it was a moment of total calm that we never had. But there was a big fight happening. There was a very serious fight going on."Kubrick then went on to describe the scene where he says he met kim. "We were in the parking lot and he was sitting in front of the car. It was just me, a young man, a little, he did not look like kim at all, I don't know. And I was shaking and he was crying a little bit at that point, I think about that."Kim then described the fight as well."And I remember, he started to cry. Like, 'daddy!' But I remember he's like, 'what's up?' And I remember we just hugged. And then, I remember he got up from bed and he was shaking and that was it. But there was a second fight that went on a little bit longer. He had some fights and he got very upset. And then we kind of went to bed, and I remember crying. And I think it was really sad to tell him that we had a big fight. It wasn't like I was getting angry, but like I said, he really wanted my money. And I think because he got a good deal, that he wanted to go in there and fight, they had ...
727|i saw that the old man in the bar was still trying to tell his story. It was so old man in that bar. He had to tell his story to get his business back up. That was our way of saying that he was trying to sell to the other bartender who was working to keep it going. So he took a call. He'd said, 'hey look, if you're going to sell your business you have to sell it to the other customer.' He said, 'you're not gonna sell it to my customer. You're gonna sell it to the other customer,' so I called him. He said, 'i understand what you're saying,' but he couldn't do the job. He couldn't do the job. He didn't have the money for us to do it and I was just trying to get my business back up. I was trying to sell my business to the other customer. And he just said to me, 'you know what, that customer wasn't selling it to me. I don't know how he got that number of customers.' I asked the guy who is making the numbers on that phone from his account and he responded, 'yeah. He did get 10 customers last night.' I just said, 'i understand.'When this man went to work, we got $200 in our pockets.When the day when I started working, I got $200 in my pocket.We got that money al...
728|It took four years for the fbi to secure these records. Then, five years for them to get them all in place. They took every possible step necessary to get those records in place. Those were very difficult times for law enforcement. And now there's now a group of people who have joined with the aclu, people like me who are looking for justice for the families and the people of ferguson, missouri, who have been devastated by this.Amy goodman: we're joined by the aclu lawyers for the brown family, who are challenging the legality of ferguson's police actions, saying that they are entitled to legal assistance. The organization filed a lawsuit for civil rights and compensation in august this year, calling for a change in the law, based on federal court rulings against the police and ferguson police. We're going to have them go back into court.What do you think has been the impact that ferguson police have upon our rights?Amy goodman: michael dreeben, who represented darren wilson in the ferguson shooting, you represented the family in this lawsuit, and have now lost his suit.M. Douglas dreeber: absolutely, absolutely.Amy goodman: but we're going to turn to justice dreeben, who is now involved in the lawsuit against the police, and he's a partner at a large law firm in los angeles called the law firm.

729|A friend of mine was very much involved in the local sports community in los angeles and had this relationship. A friend of mine was working on a basketball team. And he had his girlfriend working there that year. And she was working there for a long time before he left. He was a really good basketball player and he wanted her to be a big part of that team.And her relationship with the coach started to develop with his dad and his wife. And that relationship became extremely personal and it began to spread to other kids, too. And those kids were pretty good to be around with, especially in the weight room because his dad had been a big fan of his.So I started talking to other kids. I told them about the coaches -- the kids were very close friends. But they didn't know exactly what to make of it.The first day I spoke to each kid, I told them that I wanted them to know that their dad was probably a great coach. I wanted them to think about what it means to be a really good coach. They were very confused as to why I would want that, that's all. I told them what it means to be a great coach and what it means to have a lot of fun.And they were very supportive. And they didn't just want it to be a secret. They wanted me to come to them as they grew up and tell them what it means to be a great coach...
730|You're sitting on the ground, a couple of guys are smoking. They all have bad vibes. And you're standing in the middle of the lane, they all have bad vibes. And then you turn around to see them sitting in the middle of the lane and you see somebody coming on their way out. You don't know. You think you know. They're sitting in the middle of the lane. You ask that question a couple of times. And you hear somebody screaming from the middle and you say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa!" And you hear them go outside. And you remember that all the while. You remember. You don't know who did that. What I did was I did that the hard way, that I said, "Well, if you've done this with me before, tell me." There weren't any good reasons for that to happen. That story doesn't make sense. So I did have a good excuse. My bad plan. I was trying to do this. I was on the phone with a friend of mine, someone who had been with us for 18 years. He's a friend of mine, his buddy. And he just walked up to me and he was saying, "Hey, you know what? You should probably do this, you know what, so you don't do this." He said, "Yeah, that's what I did," And he said that to me and he told me, "Thi...
731|My wife had a great job. She had her son. My wife thought that she was going to be in charge of our household. But she was not. It was a dream.She asked me then what I would do for her. She said, "My husband is not allowed to use the restroom." Why? I said, "I'm not allowed to use the restroom." My husband said, "What do you mean?" "They will find out about this later."My wife said, "Well do you understand?" I said, "I don't know but I want you to have your child, and I'm going to have my wife do her jobs."She said, "Then how can I get into this place?"I said, "Well, you're going to have your boy's birth certificate. He'll be a doctor."My wife said, "You don't want that. I think I'llbe on call. Go and find out what happened."My wife said, "How can I do that?" Her husband said he didn't want her to be in charge of my child. My wife said, "Well let me take a look. I found a guy in a hotel room, and I was there with my son." My wife said, "Why did I have to go there?" My husband said, "Because you're not here for that."My husband told me to go dow...
732|When I was a kid in high school, I didn't know that there was a place for women in the movie industry in new york. That was just a weird place," She says."I don't remember the day, but for the first time in my life I was in a movie theater. I just didn't know what to do with it.""The first time I went to movie theaters, my mom always insisted that I be dressed, that I do something special, but I was never told what to do," She continued. "When I was a kid, I just thought 'mom, I want my kids to become famous.' I was pretty obsessed with this stuff, but when I was a little girl, I went off to a little dance club to get some girls.""My mom said, 'you're supposed to have a special time with your kids to have a good time, you're not supposed to do anything in front of your kids,' and that's exactly what I did. I had a lot of fun with the movies. It's not a lot. And so for my kids, at least I thought, 'well, I can do something really special to have a good time with my kids.' ""When I was a kid, I remember being at a bar who had a great time. The bar was full of girls and I was going to take a dance class. I was really into it. I did...
733|I first found this thing and began writing. I had written many stories about people from my family, my friends, my children. I've never found this stuff for it, or this stuff for it's own sake. No, I don't care about what the story is about. It's for my own good. No, no, no, no. It's just the story of me. When I was a kid, my dad was doing what you call a "Revolving door" When the door opened and I said, "Hey! Whoa, how come I know you guys won't kill me?" His face was looking down at me. I thought, what? I said, what's wrong with this? I don't know, I just thought he was going to kill me.The first time I talked to the police, they got in the car and drove down to the house. They started driving down toward me. My father told them I was his big sister and he told me he couldn't wait to hear what the cops say. I didn't want to believe that.I thought, is my good little sister still alive? Is they going to kill her for being a victim? I asked my little sister if anything had changed in my life. They said yes. My little sister is dead and we'd all have my back.I was told that my parents had moved to canada and that they could live in canada without my knowin...
734|I was living in the philippines from 1981-2005. That was the time of the communist regime there. It was an unenviable situation. There were so many people, such as me, and there were so many people. It was a very difficult situation. I was living in the same area as everybody else in the philippines, and I felt it was a challenge. I had to get my life together with the people. That was the worst experience."As a kid, my childhood was spent in the jungle. So we had lots of little things that were in the jungle. We went to the jungle, you know, the jungle is so far away from the place and it's so crowded that there are all kinds of people waiting.""The jungle. All of it.""The jungle. All of it. But people would come back and see all of these little things. I was very tired from my whole life being in the jungle. It was all very difficult for me.""The jungle. All of it. I was going to spend my life in the jungle every day. Everything was so hard that it was hard to sleep, to read, to make the sounds. I was pretty exhausted, pretty tired.""My mom, my dad, my brothers, my sisters, all of them — everything I could think of to do or say to them was going to be difficult enough to go back to my mom....
735|My mother was a little girl, a little bit younger than me. But when I was growing up I was like, "I guess I'm supposed to be a girl now." And I was like, "What? What are you doing, you little girl? You know what to do?" And my mother's friends wouldn't have the courage to do that, because they wanted to kill me.And she went, "Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not here for this. I'm not here for that." And they all got on a plane and just flew away. My mom went to china with her sister and they were so angry at me that they just told me to shut up and never go back. And then I was like, "Ok, what do we do now?" And then I said to myself, "What are you going to do?" And my mother said, "I'm going to go with the other girl. I'm going to do it." And it was like, "Yeah, I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it! I'm going to do it!" And then she said, "You know, if I don't stop, you go home and you'll never go back." So I went to mexico [on a boat] and said, "Alright, well, I'llkill you, but not like this, so I'lljust let you go." So that's the kind of thing going on...
736|We were going into a big group meeting at my school to try to work on a novel with a lot of friends. After a while of brainstorming, I decided to make the novel a little bit more interesting for them. I wrote the story as part of a trilogy of events which were being planned out at different times in the past, and to keep the story as fresh and interesting as possible. This gave me time to prepare a little piece of paper to put together a list of the events leading up to the meeting in the first half of the novel and also have it prepared out by me, myself or someone I trust. I knew that there were many characters that I wanted to write and also wanted to make sure that it would be a little more relatable for them. The idea of writing an original story didn't work out in the end because I was still in the midst of a series of plot-lines that I had to make up in the novel and had to take a break from it, so I had to write it in between the events in the story that was happening and just focus on what needed to happen at that time. It was a very difficult assignment, and I don't think I ever would have been able to write one if not for writing the story out of an original script. I had to make it a lot more interesting for the people involved than I ever could have been able to do in a novel. I tried to get the story as relatable to the...
737|the one I want to tell you right now is about the story of the first female superhero game I ever played as a kid. I played it as a kid on my first day of school. I was playing in the back row with my friends when it came out, we were all getting ready to go play a show, I was a little nervous because I never expected to be in a game like that with girls. I was just doing the stuff I wanted to do. This was my first day of school and before you could ask me about it, I had to ask my parents and tell their stories. They were very supportive and kind, they said that you have to be prepared if you want to be a superhero. But I was in my teens and I was playing this game in high school and I really enjoyed it and it made me want to be a superhero. After playing all the games I was playing it over the course of my school year, I got a job as a writer and I got a job with a company that was making games. I had worked at a comic book company for five years, I worked at a movie studio for 20 years, I got a job at a computer company for 10 years, and now I'm writing for a movie company. And all of a sudden I couldn't get into a game like this. I was so nervous because I couldn't do anything.And here's what I saw from my eyes that gave me the nervou...
738|In 2008 you had a friend who worked at the us state department—a us ambassador to iraq. Before that, he had been working with the iraqi government. He was on the frontlines, and he was dealing with people who were very important to that government. And he was very impressed and surprised by these people. In this role, he thought that they were the right people to help them. And they are very good people. You are doing well in the state department. The situation is not a good one, they say. And that's when things got weird. One of the people you were working with, and I know you know a lot about iraq, is tony blair, who at the time was secretary of state—amy goodman: and he was in his office.Stephen cooper: yes. And he had never met the iraqi government, I imagine.Stephen cooper: that was the first I heard of him. The first time he spoke to me was in february, he made a promise to the american people, not in public, but he promised them a way to avoid a nuclear war. It was not in public, you know, but he said he would give it to the iraqi people. And it was not a good offer. And we were getting really nervous—amy goodman: no, no, he wasn't willing to give it to the iraqi people.Stephen cooper: h...
739|in 2009, I had my first child, a girl I was getting married to. At the time we were still in my mid-30s, but there was no one there who was old enough to be a dad. I did my best to go along, but nothing happened.We didn't have a great wedding reception that year. We had to walk a mile to get to the wedding reception. We had to pay our bills and pay the wedding guest list. We didn't even know our wedding guest list existed. There were literally no wedding guests that would even want to come to our venue for a party.We were told that our family would never find us at an event like that. It was so obvious that it was the worst experience I could ever have.My first son, a girl named alyssa, was born and raised in a very different city. I did not learn from his experiences. I went to church in my hometown that year. My hometown did not seem to be welcoming. My home district was not as supportive. I was never able to be a good dad because my home was not very good.I went to church with my new girlfriend and I spent the night there crying and crying and crying over what my husband did to me. I was terrified. I was scared. I was trying to make peace with myself. I told myself that I was wrong. I wasn't the guy to say it. ...
740|It is not for a minute; you would like to share about that one with your friends.A friend of mine was in the bathroom with a small group of us. We had walked by her house one night. She had just gotten her daughter out of bed and she thought it was a good idea to tell us about it when we arrived. Apparently she noticed the man who sat in her bathroom reading a book just before she walked out! She didn't say anything to help him figure it out. No one did.Later, I noticed her looking up at him. She was looking at a book that was in a drawer on the table, just above the sink. She had picked it up.As I was talking to her friend, she gave me a quick smile and said, "You know, it is a problem I had with my mom before. She came by the house without telling anyone. I had to ask her. She kept me in bed for a short time. So I had to ask her, 'do you want me to leave?' And she said yes. And there was nothing. She was just sitting there with her eyes closed. And she never came back."This was really the first time I'd ever heard her say it out loud, so I didn't want to say anything. I wanted to let it be known that she had never told anyone, that I was the one who was the target.I took som...
741|Just a few weeks ago, I was visiting my sister and her mother in japan and came across a piece of paper that was so bizarre that she thought I was crazy. At first I thought I was crazy because she had just gotten her japanese passport and the person was sitting on her back. She couldn't remember any of the details of the accident. Then I went into my room with my head down and saw what looked like a large plastic sheet of white paper with a large black hole on it. "Oh god," Said my sister, "What's that?" The person was holding the paper around her neck and holding it tightly and I couldn't believe it. She said that she thought she saw a white blob and looked at me with a sad look on her face and said, "I'm sorry, this is crazy. But no, I'm not crazy, I'm a real normal girl. It's impossible to be normal." A moment later, I just said, "Sorry, but I'm not crazy. I'm just a normal boy. It makes sense because I do believe a girl will be normal." I looked in my mirror and I saw that my dad was looking happy and happy. But I could never understand why they had thought that there could be a woman in japan without his father. I think I can understand why they thought I was crazy.The next day, we started to walk to the house where it was found. Before I even left, the ca...
742|I worked at the time, I was a high school student, I had just finished the first semester of high school, and I was at a restaurant in a small town that had been destroyed by fire. Suddenly a woman came up to me and said, "Mom, I just saw those bodies with your dead body and so I feel bad for you." So I came forward, because I was sick, and I said, "I'm sorry. My brother died in the fire. My brother is still alive. I can't believe the number of people i've worked with who were like, "What can you do, I'm going to kill you." It's so tragic because it hurts, and it's very sad because it's really heartbreaking stuff. But at the end of the day, I was in a really tough relationship. You know, I was devastated by the fire, the whole house was burned down, my girlfriend had to get out of bed. But there was a very good support system that didn't shut me down. There was help, and a couple of good people started coming through. We talked about stuff like that. And now I'm so grateful for that. When you do this, there's a lot of work to do. So you go into the fire, and your brother's body is burned in the firehouse. And you say, "I know what this happened, but I'm just so grateful that I got out of that fire. I know wha...
743|We just got into a big fight about a movie at the start of the month. It was about a girl who was a teenager, a girl with a very different story to us. She was the only one we could get to the end of the film. So it wasn't quite the sort of movie we could put on the shelf or even make into a reality. We knew a lot about the movie and we wanted it to be realistic, and not get watered down or watered down. So we had some sort of idea of how we were going to get this one-on-one fight. It's really a different sort of fight than you might think. It's more of an epic. We started shooting that scene at the end of the story, and there are moments where she's really angry with him for saying things to her. We have all those moments, but they don't come when these two guys really need to fight each other.The first time we did this scene, it was a couple times and it was like, "What have you done with that last kiss?" At various moments, in between these scenes, these two guys could be out of it but they weren't going to talk. So a couple times, if you've ever hit a fight, the first time you'll just sit there and let it go, then it'll be over. But the fact that it was the way it was, I think that was definitely a little to...
744|My name is mark schmitt and I was born in the chicago area of illinois. As a high school biology teacher, I read some of the best science fiction, fantasy and comic books. When I was younger, I read a few horror anthologies, the first of which was the best-selling collection, a year in the life of arthur conan doyle. I would later read the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy by alan moore and the harry potter series, the first book in the series which dealt with a very real and alien character. However, all of the books were written on the same schedule. So after a few months in the classroom, I was inspired to take the science fiction thing further. As I grew older, both my interests and my desire to learn more about science fiction became more intense. I was in the late '1960s. At that time, science fiction had never been successful at winning awards for science. But after I had done my research, especially in the 1940s, more and more people started to read science fiction. As I read science fiction, I started to think about how much could be learned from it. I was told that there is an enormous amount of material. And, after that, I started to read more and more, reading a lot of books. I started to look at how science fiction has evolved over time. And, I realized that maybe it is because there are fewer novelists and more authors.The author's nam...
745|I was in the middle of a fight with a guy who was in a big restaurant and this guy had his hair combed. He was talking about how the food in his restaurant was a little bit too sweet for him. We sat down and he was like, 'you don't understand anything about your food, do you?' I said, 'yeah', and he said [to himself], 'well, I guess I'm going to take care of that.'"With his hair combed, the one thing they all agreed to was a "Good" Meal.Gunnock has spent most of his career with mcdonald's. His first book, the great new american meal, was published in 1984 and was the first major book he released on the topic. However, he has since sold more than 10 million copies.In 2010, the company released the movie "The great american meal." The movie was a sequel to the original, the great american meal which starred kevin hart, john cusack, james dean, and woody harrelson. The movie also stars peter dinklage and david oyelowo...
746|Two weeks ago, I had been working on an episode of the television series star trek: the next generation. In that episode and the episode before that, someone was trying to figure out how the enterprise might work. When we were trying to figure out how the first two years of the star trek films would work, I decided, let's just go back to working on star trek when we had just published an amazing issue of the new york times, and we just began doing research on the idea of going on an enterprise-style interstellar voyage. At that point, I needed a way to make such a concept work properly and, really, I wanted to see it, so I did. I was very happy with the results. It was really quite satisfying and very different.I'm going to do more research on star trek when I run my own show with the help of the show's writers. I'll actually be interviewing writers and designers who i've interviewed with and I will be doing what everyone has done for star trek since. It's a really exciting time, and I hope you'll enjoy this time with me.[editor's note: this interview was first published by wired magazine....
747|A friend of mine in the middle of the night, I didn't see her, we were talking for about a minute, and she came up in my bedroom and she was trying to take the shower and she asked us to take her phone and then we didn't even do anything to keep her from doing it. Then we just said, 'no, I need to call her over. She's coming and I feel like she's been doing this for hours.'"Hogan said he didn't know if that was a "Real" Threat."You have to be vigilant," He said, "Because you know, if there's a threat, we will. So you don't want to keep your phone in your pocket. So we said, 'no, no. We're not going to give out your phone. We're not going to make you call him over, we want to talk over this. You want to talk to us over that phone, you want to talk to us over this phone and you want to talk over that phone.'"The victim is now being held at the university of washington jail. According to the post, she has since been released, but a court date is set for nov. 23...
748|I was in a meeting in europe and someone asked me a question. I said, "Why do you want to ask me this question? The people of our country want to hear the truth," And they started cheering the idea of doing this and now I'm in the process of answering that.In the beginning, the people don't want to know the truth. They want to know everything they can, because they don't know what they can say. And it's just this mentality that's really important in a democracy. They're not giving up their right to freedom of speech and they don't give up their right to freedom of assembly and they just want to do what's right. This is what democracy is about. That's what democracy means. And everybody who has ever stood for freedom of speech or anything else is right to express their opinion.The other thing is that it's important to understand a little bit more about the media's role in democratization and how important it is, because it's a problem. It's a problem for people, and it's a problem for the media, because they don't understand the very basic truth. They don't even understand what happens on tv in russia. They know everything about them, and they're willing to talk about it. But also, they can't even imagine.The first thing you have to understand about how much media influence or influence comes from government, isn't that that happens all the time an...
749|back in the days of the first millennium b.C., the yayyyy and the t'aiy of the yayoi, are actually the same thing. In the yayoi, the t'aiy is called the yayoi yayoi or yayaya yayaya or yayaya hoshikiri yayoi (god is god). The yayoi yayoi in the old testament is called yayoi yayoi yayoi, which means "The way of the lord." In the new testament, the yayoi yayoi is called yayoi hoshikiri yayoi (god is god). The yayoi yahya yayoi is the way when it is called "Hoshikiri yahya yayiya," Which means "The way of the way of the yayoi." Now, in the yayoi, the yahya yayoi is the yayoi yahya yayiya, (god is god). When it is called "Hoshikiri yahya yahya yayiya" (god is god), the yayoi yayoi is the yayoi yahya yayiya; and when it is called "Hoshikiri yahya yahya yayiya" (god is god), the yayoi yahya yayiya is the yahya yayiya.The god of the old testamen...

752|A very, very short story about three men from the north, and their family. They are a small family of seven. They are living in a house of some kind. They are pretty well educated. And they live in a small house. But they seem very upset, very angry. They think they were some kind of monster, a witch, or something, or they just think that when their daughter goes to school in her white dress, a man comes to take her and they want to kill her. They go in to hide and wait for a while. But then they say that when they saw them, they were all looking at them with such a serious face, and they told them to come home. And they said, "No, I won't. We can't do it. I want to go home to my wife." Now, they would not give up. All they want is to leave home and not be seen in public. Not that they don't want that. Why? Because that would be their way of making sure that they are safe. But they are really upset, really angry. And so they go home, and that disturbs them. But their father said to them, "No. We must go out to get our children." They said, "Father, you don't have to go through that one. It is fine if we stay out here. We will help you out here." And their father said, "We will." And I think tha...
753|You were a young lad growing up in the united states, a kid who had his father's name engraved on his forehead. A man named george w. Bush came from the same family of families that were the cause for my grandfather's name. It wasn't just that the name changed. It really changed my identity. It was that I was the first one that was identified by god as being the one to save the world from an evil being who was trying to destroy it.The fact is that I was born on march 27th, 1971. I was born in california, my father, robert, was the great poet who was a teenager in los angeles and was studying at harvard. I was also on an aa class at the time when I was 17 and I was a member of the aryan brotherhood. I was also a member of the naacp. The naacp stood against slavery. That was a very clear statement to me.Robert was a good boy and a good man. He was in his late 20s at the time and had become a preacher and writer. He liked music in particular. He was a very good songwriter as well. He would sing and write about issues of religion and things like that. It seemed that his life was a very special one.One of the first people I met at the aa meeting was the black poet and singer bill o'connell, who had just left his home in california. O'connell was a great jaz...
754|The first time I went to the hospital, I realized that what I was doing was wrong. I was in shock, and my partner, a nurse, told me that in the hospital I was being treated for prostate cancer. I sat there and said that I should go home and start over and see my family. There was so much anger and disgust, and I told my partner how sorry I was for what had happened to me. I said, "It was a mistake, I don't know what my future is like, and I'm sorry I went in there to look at my family." That was my biggest mistake. I knew that my whole life was being damaged like that, and I felt it was not my job to take care of that. I went to see my mother at the hospital. She was in pain by the time she came back from surgery, and I tried a lot in the er, but I was there to help her to a point where she was able to walk. It was like sitting there and watching my mother, and seeing how she looked. She was going through some pain, but I knew something was wrong, and I tried to help her and see how she looked. My best friend came back after surgery, and we talked to her for about nine hours, before she found out I was an operative. She said, "I can't help you because I see you in the hospital. I don't know why you're in the hospital." I sai...
755|After I got my degree I went to the library and had one of my teachers teach me how to set up a book in english. She said, "Look, you must be a master of the language. Have you ever read the book so many times that you know what's in it and how to write it? Are you saying that no one in your school knows the english language?" And I immediately went home and read all the books. And then I met my future teacher. We went to my class and I just couldn't get through the first sentence.That was when I got a job as a cook at the local restaurant. The waitress made sure you knew the english so I wouldn't just read the book at you. It wasn't even my first job. I mean, the restaurant was my first job.I had always been a perfectionist. I know that I have made great decisions at certain times, but when I'm busy, I'm always open to change. Now that I'm a self-employed cook, I don't have to go a whole lot of work. And when I'm in the kitchen, I'm always open to change.And then there's the fact that this interview took place in new york. The restaurant's closed this summer. We were waiting for someplace to open in my neighborhood where we could go to eat and have a great time.So there are a lot of things to take away. ...
756|One day, I see my wife in the hospital with my eyes closed. She's bleeding from her face, and I can feel blood coming from her mouth! We were there about 15 minutes ago, and I'm still not clear about her condition. She looks like she was struck by lightning or something or something, and she's in shock. It was like she just ran off her feet and the doctors didn't know what to do.I'm still in shock. I had never seen anything like that before or since. The doctors said it was pretty severe, but I kept trying to get her to go back in the hospital because I think they should have treated her better. The doctors took her in an ambulance and took her through the hospital with a wheelchair. I'm so glad I did it.So as soon as I saw the doctor and the surgeon, which was really cool and reassuring, I got ready to walk out of there. I was about 4:45 in the morning. I was walking around with my hands out on my hips and legs doing cardio. I went up and put my hands up to her face and she started crying. Then I told my wife that that was what they should have done.My mom said, "If you have to tell her, call us, we'll do it as long as it's safe for her." I didn't care a lot about that one because I wasn't doing anything. I couldn't go...
757|A story that was shared on social media by a student at georgetown who spoke about her experience and the importance of coming forward. I mean, you get to share those experiences in social media. As I said, as a person of color, I see this as a big step forward in what's possible. And I think it's very important that we get on television talking about what's happening in the world and why we need to move forward. People like me need to stand up for the stories in the world that we love. I think we should be talking about that. I'm not going to repeat myself.It is important that we address these issues within the mainstream. We need to be able to focus on what we do and the way that other people are interacting. In order to have a place for that, there needs to be a place for diversity in the world. And the diversity has been going on for a long time, and we need to create one...
758|One of the great discoveries of the last few decades in american politics was the discovery that so much information is available to everyone about the workings of the big corporations. This has given us a new kind of information, a new kind of understanding of who really is on their side and who are going to win elections against them. And we know that we are in a moment where it is actually time for those political forces to put their political hands in front of the media.So let us do that by talking a little bit more about what are the big issues of our time right now. First of all, how big is the government? How big are we talking about the health of our nation, and how do we build the infrastructure to actually deal with the future, that is this big government we can just walk under. There are four pillars that are built in the united states government: the executive branch, the legislative branch, the judiciary, and the military. These two branches, the executive and the legislative, are different. Each branch is built around a certain goal: to accomplish what the executive is seeking to accomplish. This is a very specific, very specific goal, and we should recognize that. And that is what's going on right now, because, first of all, that it is very, very costly for congress to legislate, and for the president to legislate and to govern, and to go into the senate and to go into the house to work with the president. An...
759|I said, "We've never even been here before." And said, "Why are you selling coffee here?"They said, "We're not in miami, but we just bought coffee there." I said, "What do you mean?"They said, "We wanted to buy coffee."I said, "Well, let me ask you three questionsthere you go," I said, "What's your name?"They said, "My name is jimi love this city."I said, "My kids love it, they'll go to miami this year."I remember that moment when I said, "You should live here forever."...
760|When you started, you thought, "Oh, this is really cool. This can do with a little bit of work and a little bit of luck, but I think it will be the best piece of software on the market to date." This is where things ended up.It's hard for me to say anything, but it's what i've learned from this one application where I built a single unit which works, for all intents and purposes, as a single command and I couldn't be happier.I've also learnt some great things as a developer and one of the great things about the company is that it takes time to get things working, and that this was something I wanted to show you what it was and how you can learn from it. And the results so far have been amazing...
761|I've been living in this kind of world for a long time now. I was born in the first seven months of my life. My family knew exactly where I was at. I didn't believe that I was gay; I didn't want to believe that people would think I was gay. I didn't really think that was a big deal, but I couldn't help but think about it. All of a sudden I had something that I hadn't known all my life and I'd spent so much time thinking about, and I was living in the middle of a very hard reality.I came to know many people who really believed I was gay, and they were the ones who were the ones that were really, really upset and upset that I thought that I was gay. And they would cry. They said, "No, that is not true." No. It was not true—it wasn't a really true situation. I was raised as a woman, I was raised as a father, so when the news came out—in the late 1980s and early '90s—when the news came out I was angry, and I was angry that the media was doing the things that they were doing. And now that I am alive, and I'm not worried about what might happen with the media, I know there are going to be some repercussions, but I don't know what the ramifications really are for me.I'v...
762|I was a 20 year old student at my alma mater, the college of engineering, when I was approached by an online recruiter on his behalf. He was going to take my resume, which led me to the conclusion that I was the "Best prospect" Out there and that it's important to have an online college offer.I responded:i'm a senior in university. I applied for all the major institutions for my college application (phd, ph.D., mba, cs, etc.). The last two days I was denied, and had to go back to my dorm room. The only time I talked to any of my friends, and my classmates were all in great spirits…they told me that they didn't like me on social media. I had to explain the reasons that they were not going to let me finish my degree for a while because I was a freshman. I couldn't even afford a two-credit or two-year university degree. I was so worried about my future, that I began applying for scholarships. And for several months I was waiting for my application to be considered. In mid- june I received another rejection.This story isn't unique to me either—after being denied I still had an opportunity to make a career, a job, a career that could have gone to my parents. I thought I was a good candidate. Now I am the "Best prospect" Out there. I've applied fo...
763|The thing about this show is that you get to see it first hand and you see it in your mind. And then you read the book. So that's kind of the point that I wanted to make. And so I decided to write a short story about it. And I hope you enjoy it. I think there's much more going on in it.Avc: how does this turn out for you?Gulfman: well, I think the first thing that is interesting is that there was one character named george, who used to be a professor at columbia university, who also worked for a company called the columbia-riverton school of politics. He worked for a company called the columbia, and he took his kids, their wife, and kids, and he was a professor. And they went to columbia for four years and then this guy called steve came to columbia, and he brought a bunch of people to columbia, and steve, from the other side, went to columbia and hired all of this people. And then we decided to hire steve for our story. And I said, "We want steve to be the writer," And he was. Yes, he's a professor, so he was.And we wanted him to write for us in terms of the big story. The big story is that in the early '60s, a great many of the very prominent figures in political science were already on the political scene, and steve...
764|Our friend said, "It's been a long time since I spoke to you." I said, "How long have you been reading a novel?" He said, "I read about my parents, my siblings and their daughters, my brothers and sisters. I read a ton of novels. You're a nice person. You're not so important to my life. I feel like i've spent a lot of time with your mother and mom." I said, "Okay. You can read. You can read this. This is going to be a huge book." She said, "You can write it. Your father is an artist, and you read it. If your father wants to do something, or if you know he wants to do something, go with it. Don't go with it." And it was just a huge deal. I read it. And i've had a lot of fun. I loved my parents. They're fine-tunes of mine and I want them as well, and they're well-tunes of mine with me. And they didn't want to know what to do with it, so they asked me to write this novel. And every time I read a novel you're like, "Whoa, this is so fun to write, I want to write this." It made me feel better, and I said, "I don't want to go around telling people that I write this." I would have done anything to not be out there...
765|A young boy was playing in a playground at the time of a shooting on the corner of 15th and seventh street in the west village. He was walking along the sidewalk, and suddenly there was an explosion. On the corner below the blast, a young boy got out of the car, took off his coat, walked to the curb, walked through the crowd and shot into the crowd and then shot himself in the head. The young boy was still alive and was taken to the hospital, then to the hospital after several hours. The doctor said that he did think that the man shot at him was a mentally unstable man.""So you thought you weren't safe during the fight, but it's like a bomb goes off, someone dies and then you die and you're gone and you have to go back to jail."The nypd's response to the shooting, which the new york daily news reports is part of a massive investigation into the police department's response to the sept. 11 attacks, was to investigate whether a number of people had been involved in the attack, including four police officers who were injured as they were fighting in syria. The news outlet also reported that two officers were arrested following the incident.In the last week, the nypd has seen increased numbers of calls from the public about the nypd's response to the attacks. The nypd reportedly received more than 7,000 calls in the first 24 hours of the attacks, which was the highest total from any da...
766|i found a little girl who was doing a school event and I was a little mad because I could see her eyes and said to her, 'my kid's school is being bombed. Go find a place and don't forget to make sure all your stuff can survive.' That was a very sad moment for her. So I went to her and I said, 'you should have stayed there, you should have left us there and we wouldn't have had any of this happening to you, to your family, to those around you.' She said, 'no, that is not what she said.'"In other words, she had been exposed to a situation that was so horrific it made her feel like she had lost all credibility, even though she had lived it. There was no way her body would have survived. Even if her mind had not, she would have died."People look at me like crazy, and I know that. It's not because I'm a crazy person. I am a man for a living, a man for a love. My daughter has a good heart, and she looks at me like a crazy person on a daily basis. She said, 'i'm scared because I have this fear. I am in a real mental breakdown, and I can't stand it.' But she is a woman. This is who she is, and she has lived it for her child. She has been in this way for so long, and sh...
767|A lot of people who are new to the market think that this is the next big thing, because it's what you've been used to and the possibilities are so new.We're just coming back with this whole platform of the internet. People want access to other, better ways to do things with their personal information. We're trying to bring it back. Our goal is to democratize it, to make sure all of us get this information right, or that we don't get it all right, but instead, we want it to be something that people can use and that people can have access to. That's not something we like to talk about today, or in any way, shape or form. We're trying to get back some of that.We're really excited about the possibilities of the iot and what it can, and want to make the world a better place. We think about that as something that should be an integral part of the future of personal computing, and that it can allow us to do what we want to do now. For instance, we're using the internet for more than just the internet. It's all connected. It's connected to our home or other places, too.We want to make your home more productive, like the refrigerator, or the oven, or even your car. The internet has a very wide range of uses. It can give you any activity. It can give you a safe way to share things, eve...
768|I took a couple of months off from running to my job. I was working full time at a big tech company. I've been on the job for about 2 years working for a small company. This past year, my wife and I went to a business school (for the past year!). We ended up getting a job at google's research lab. We were very fortunate that after working so long to get promoted, we had to work so hard to get promoted. This is the type of situation for a new employee. They might have a hard time getting promoted to the boss.My wife and I found out that our company had hired a couple of guys from a large tech company. We decided to hire people who work for google and have a lot of hard work to put up with. We decided to do a google search to find these guys. The search engine result turned up no job postings from our office. No job postings from the company.My wife went out to a mall (we were very lucky) and there was no job posting from our office that day. We were told that they had paid well for us and we couldn't help but feel that they did good. We were offered a job at google, but our search engine was very low.Our search engine was very low. We had to find out if these guys from the company that we worked at were here for something better…i think what's interesting is that my wife though...
769|when mike and I walked into john ritz's apartment one night, they went to sleep in their beds. I took michael's phone, and we had to go through a couple of things. 1) the phone was on the other side of the room where the two of us lived. We took the phone. We walked downstairs to where john was in jail, he was just going through some paperwork. 2) outside was a bunch of people. He had just come out from work and was having a few drinks.I went up to him to ask him what was going on and I told him he had no idea what was going on. So, we sat down and I didn't want to go into details."Well, mike, I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you that he's going to tell you that. He's going to tell you that they're going to tell you that. That they're going to tell you that he's going to tell you that he knows you're not going to like it. And he's going to get you to tell him what she told you. And to tell you something. He's going to get you to get him to tell you this.I said, you know, I'm sorry."Mike, that's your mommy." I said, I'm not going to.He said, no, mike. "Well, tell me wha...
770|I was 16 at that time. I was in the middle of the movie, the opening and ending of the revenant. The movie was about a girl who is a woman named juliette marie. So I was like, that's my character. I was 15 at the time, and I was playing that girl named juliette marie. And I was at college. So I was like, what? I was 14. I was like, I'm not playing juliette marie.What does it mean to you, to your family, the world, the lives you're living?I've been living at that. And i've been living here for seven years now. I was in college for 15 years. And I was in my 19th decade in college. And I was a teacher and a teacher and a teacher. And I had a class with one character that would say, this is going to be the last time we're going to see it. And somebody would say, well, that's going to be the last time we see it.So that's my story. And my story was that I was 16. And I was really kind of at a loss for words when I was at that time, because what happened, I don't know, and it just didn't work out that way.And I remember saying, well, you know, maybe I'm just going into a bit of an argument, but I just think i'l...
771|When I was about three years old, my dad brought me some really old bottles of liquor. I was an expert at finding the right amount of alcohol that we would use during our trips together. So I started going to the liquor store. That's when I remember, there you go. We've just been back from vietnam. You know, we were on a plane. They said, "You're not allowed to bring any of that stuff, sir," And we were kind of looking for some kind of a big bottle of whiskey you'd keep. But we found a big bottle in the back of the store, and we were told we couldn't bring anything else. Then I took the big bottle out and I brought it up to the store. And every time I turned to see it, it popped out and I had to tell my parents what it was.When you were on your own when you were 9, you had to deal with the kids. You had to deal with the family.Oh, and if my dad did end up going into college and being a great student and doing things like that, I would do a lot worse than him.Yeah, you could really hear you saying that.Yeah, but I couldn't hear you say anything.Yeah, I thought you would be fine.But that's your story. That's my story. And I had no idea I could say to someone like me, lik...
772|It is quite unusual to hear about such issues on a weekly basis, and I have never heard of a case where a doctor from a different place (pakistan or nigeria) was able to provide a medical opinion of a man who had been treated for a heart attack on his way to work at a hospital.In the past I have heard about a case where a surgeon from the same local hospital had seen the same patient in hospital, and said to her that he needed to be treated for heartburn. She asked for an opinion on this, and to which he replied that the doctor from the hospital had found him a good doctor. This surgeon had told her that his opinion was one and the same as what the doctor was saying, but he did not have any facts against him to back up his belief. They asked the woman how her mother worked and she then said that it looked like she was being treated like an animal. The doctor replied that the woman had shown great care for her welfare and that this was the reason why she had given up her job. The woman said she would like an explanation, and when she answered why she had given up her job she was told that it was because she had been refused a job that night.How did it happen? The woman was told that she was given a job that night, but was told that she was getting called back and denied her work. This was then followed by another call from the doctor that her mother had received ...
773|The woman who lived with me before I met that man, that was really me."I told her that I didn't know why.I told her that I didn't remember him.I told her that I didn't know his wife.She shook her head"You just don't feel like this."I told her that I was not sure what to do.She said, "I know what you're gonna do.""What do you mean?" I asked her"I want to find this woman."She nodded, and I started to move....
774|i was living in a little town in northern ohio, around the foothills of the appalachian mountains. There was an older, more imposing man living in the area and I wanted him to be more than a person, to me. I wanted him to be a father figure and I wanted him to be a man.I was looking for someone to help me with my life, but I couldn't find someone. And I had met a girl a while ago and she could relate.This is her mom. She took me to see her, she really did. She told me a story.Now she came back and told me how little she wanted to be a father, how she wanted to be a woman. And she was really, really happy and beautiful and this was the one moment that I just stopped. I just stopped.And it was just really, really, really beautiful.There was another girl, so there was that. Maybe her mom took her to see me?And we're going to talk a little bit about her mom. She's really important to me.Let's go back to the story. She was so sweet and very sweet. She was a little bit of a shy girl, but she had this very good spirit of a childlike way of looking at things. And so this was the perfect time for her and the idea of a happy time was just to make love again. I mea...
775|I know that it's not easy to sell a book in india. I knew that it would be hard for indian readers, and I wanted to help. So I decided to go to india to spend a year and write this book.So from time to time we hear people say that they don't know much about the book and have to read it because the publishers had not taken a look at it, but they are very interested in it. So in one of my short pieces, "Tiny indian baha'i", I tell the story of how I found out about the book at the very beginning of the year, from a very small village in chittagong, in a small province of south china. I had done research at the institute of indian studies at jawaharlal nehru university, but this was the first time people were going to ask me questions, so I asked the same questions the other day. The questions were about different kinds of religious groups living in different provinces. I was only there because I had studied at the institute of indian studies.I had written some two articles before this piece was in print, and people were interested in the way that I was addressing the question and asking them how they feel about this book and what they want to know. These people are mostly the same as mine. They all come from different villages. So they don't know much about it. The fact that they asked me these things was because I a...

777|I've been working on a book about how I went down the road to make a game of thrones. I was on a journey back to england to attend game of thrones to attend the london premiere of the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring, so I went on a trip of six weeks to london to see the premiere. I went all over the place, and my book, the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring, I took it down to london and I was there the very next day with the actor jeremy clarkson talking about his book and I went, 'wow, that's a really good book.' [laughs] I went down to cardiff and I went to london the very next day. The whole cast came back to see me play the character of bran and I went to cardiff the very next day. I went to see the cast again on december 6th with my friend and I decided to make my book after talking with the cast and the cast and actually writing the book.So that's that. You do stuff, and I don't do anything until you've got to the point where you really think a book can go from a writer to the biggest thing you can do as a journalist. I don't know what to tell this interview, but i've gotta tell you, when I went to see the irishman, I had an incredibly hard time wrapping my head around it. When I went to see the irishman, it was s...
778|When you hear our people say, 'it hurts,' they always say it is an effort and I want people to feel hurt because we were so proud of them. I think what we're seeing now is this kind of attitude and I think it's going to be important for her to see that.Kg: what sort of pressure did you feel when you were getting into the nfl, playing and training with such a high profile nfl player?D: I don't think that I ever got into a lot of pressure. It was one of those things where you look back and you say, 'yeah, what? What's the point of being on that team?' But I don't think it was an experience I had. You know, i've been a little bit scared of football and I know I didn't do a lot of stuff in college where I would go and play and stuff like that. I was a little scared of my career. I don't think it's that kind of pressure.Kg: you're no longer a college football player, but do you have any regrets that you can say about your time at rutgers?D: actually, there are two sides to every story, but that's not my point. I have regrets, and I still regret it. I could have been more successful if I had been less of a leader.Kg: you were also the first player to win a division I state championshi...
779|In 2003, I was at a restaurant with a client named john travolta, who used to work at the hotel. We had been together for three years and I was asked to serve him dinner. Travolta wanted coffee with me and my dad. I was not sure whether I had been asked to do anything.I started thinking about it and then I remember saying to travolta, "Well, this is an unexpected thing that you need to learn about. If you don't do this, there's a great chance you're not going to be able to get a job."He said, "Sure, I'lldo it." Well, what about then?I was told that I had been asked an unknown number of different jobs. I was told that one was as a waiter in the diner in new york. I never thought I was going to get a job with him. He never told me anything about any of this. It was just that when he was hired, he wanted me to learn more about what he did.The next day I was asked to sign a contract. I said, "Don't worry, I know you're working with a very good guy." So he wrote down a few things. He'd never gotten a job that I was aware of.In another case, he would have told me where to go to college, he had a job that he was passionate about, and ...
780|I'm writing a book about the life of one of the most important figures who ever lived in my life, my grandfather. I told you so in 1993. I'd been a journalist for a long time and I'd been interviewing people for a very long time and I figured I had some work to do to go to my grave and tell my story to my people. I had to learn about the fact that in the 1970s there were all sorts of events that put these people on this pedestal: some of these people were just dead, some of these people had died, some of them had been around for some long time, some of them were just people who were just living around, and some of them were just living and some of them were just surviving. And they did it. And when I came across this story, I thought in my heart that was an incredible piece of news, a phenomenal story. And, you know, I'm telling this now. And you know, I'm not the only one to do this. You know, I talked about a couple other stories about them. And they all had the same goal: to tell stories about other, different people who had died or were sick. And I have to say there were a couple of people who said to me, "You know, it's so interesting that you did it, you've got to tell this story." And he said, "Yeah, if I do, I'llbe the first person t...
781|I was born and raised in st. Louis and I'm here in st. Louis with my parents. I've been here since I was little and my mom has been here since she was four years ago.She's here because her husband and brother and sisters came here in this city as well. When I was about seven years old my grandmother came back to st. Louis and she saw me for the first time. She said she went to visit me after I returned home from our time together when we lived out here with my mom in the suburbs.Now my grandmother is from st. Louis that I met a little while ago. She's been here for about five years. She's the last one in my family.I've been here for about five years now and I'm happy about it. I love my job and I'm happy about my family. I want to go back here because I want to be closer to my family. I want to be able to do it again.I know what it feels like when they come in. They send me to work to pay off a loan. They send me to school to help me get out of a bad situation, and then I can come home one day to find that school isn't there. And they send me back home to live with my parents there.I wanted to be able to spend time in school without having to pay my loans. I want to go back here and spen...
782|My parents were not living in this part of the world and they'd taken the time to go through the process of becoming parents. My mom was a bit of a baby mama. I can remember my mother telling me, "If you want to start your own business, you have to make a commitment that you want your business to be successful." That's how it started, my parents saying, "You can't just take your daughter out and be dependent on her for jobs, like, you have the right to say no to work, no matter what you have to do."I was raised with a system where, in my case, I was supposed to go off and stay in the neighborhood during certain times of the year and then when I got home I would come back and go to work. And I wasn't always able to do that because we always had that system with us. So, I'm a good kid, but if you want to become a billionaire or just start a business, you've got to learn how to work in a way that works for your family.So, it's important for you to be able to do what you're doing, because it's so hard being dependent on your child. I also think there are good things about being married to a billionaire, because if you're dependent on someone's child, and this is the kind of relationship that you think is best for your children, then it's very important that they learn the righ...

784|The next door neighbor, like me, is not very nice to me because I don't know how to say "Yes." And this is very strange. But my friend is here and he's saying to us, "You must not tell anybody we're not nice to you." And you know why?"Because I know you're right in the middle of a heated debate with him.""Ok?""And you don't know how to say yes."The next day, the neighbor, who doesn't like to spend much time with me, invited me to his house. The neighbor didn't seem too impressed with me. He was very angry, and said that I had a problem with my neighbor. He said that his dog was barking a lot and he needed to take the dog to the vet. He had left his truck with no sign that he could pick it up. I told him that dogs can be unpredictable, but he was very adamant that he could not tell anyone when a dog was barking. But then the neighbor said that he had seen another neighbor take a dog to the vet. I told him to leave it at home, because I thought I was going to get him some new medication. He asked me if I would buy a new pair of pants, and I told him that they would need to be replaced. Then I got home, had dinner, read, and was then able to call the dog. He told me that ...
785|I came upon a group of people who had been in a fight, but the first one came in and beat me up.When I started out in a fighting way, I didn't fight very well. I was more experienced. However, I never got tired in this way. I had a lot of experience. A lot of people were fighting against me.After my first fight, I heard someone saying, "Let us use a hand to beat you. He said he didn't feel like it. He said he was a coward. Let us make a fist and beat him."But when he said it, I said, 'no. That's not who I am, I'm just a guy who's fighting against the world. I'm a leader, I'm a fighter. I'm going to fight like an army'. He said I was crazy."I didn't know how to fight. I didn't know how to go all the way to the top. But when he said it, I said, 'he didn't feel like it. He said he wasn't a coward. He said he was a leader, and he didn't want to fight, and he would take a bunch of people's money. He said this is what he wanted. He wanted to do something about it. So he did it, and then he said, 'i'm going to beat you on the ground.' I think he was talking about m...
786|This is happening to me. I mean, I'm not one of those men. But that is, as you can imagine, one of the most frustrating things you do in life. I'm not a typical man. I don't know how to deal with it. I don't even know how to tell you what sort of person I am. I could never make a phone call on my own to you with, like, the whole idea of, like, 'you know, you're just an average person.'"As for the people who do not want to work, it's a shame: "I would say that the men I worked with as a child were the ones that really believed that they could work for anybody. So that's not me. But for people like me, I'd say, 'hey, you've got two jobs, and you're looking for what you can do. It's your work, and you're doing it. Is it safe?' I would say, no, it's not. And you know what my wife has said? 'You're going to never be able to work for anybody.' We would say, 'you know about that.' And that kind of gives my wife the excuse to work for somebody else. I mean, I'm glad she was still my wife because she does my job."I had a lot of friends who said, 'you're kidding. That's not me and this is not your wife...
787|I went to see a tv set in the middle of nowhere and I was walking by a very beautiful red house in the middle of nowhere. It was the house that is the most beautiful. I looked around and saw a huge building full of people and some kids. The first thing I thought was I would love to get out of there to see the first movie. So I started to run and walk back down the street. And I kept walking with a limp. I couldn't move. I was not able to walk because the house didn't have a back door. And from that point on it had never been a house. It had never been a house before. So I thought I might as well go in and see what we could do about it, make it beautiful, and get to seeing the rest of the movie. And then we went back down that street and saw that big house from the other side of it with everything else. And we saw that red house from the other side. And I thought, hey, why don't all the kids go see that red house?Amy goodman: it started off like that. Then it went from there. But a lot of people had gone to see the red house from the other side of the house. So one day, like two days later, he went and went back to see the red house. For the first time, he saw the little red wall inbetween two different sets of windows and the tiny little red floorboard...

789|When I worked for cbs in the 1990s, I was on the executive producer of the night shift, where you could see the show. The first thing you saw was "The night shift," A show that was doing great. And I was just so amazed by the breadth of what it had to offer.There were so many fantastic people. Some of them would say, 'oh my god, this is crazy!' I was like, 'wow! I thought it was going to be like this for a while, but then one day it was like what?' There's so many great people in television right now. And I don't know if they're on the same level.We were on the show for 10 years and they didn't know about it. And I think it was really fascinating for us because they hadn't even heard about it. They thought it was crazy. And they weren't that into it at all. It was a very cool show. And I was really proud to be on it. I don't know what they thought of us.Do you think you ever heard about the night shift, even though it wasn't on network tv.I don't think it ever went into the air. It wasn't on abc. I don't know if that mattered much. I don't think anybody thought it would go on cable. What I remember was the show was a show that I did on abc, and I was always jus...
790|i have one of my older boys growing up. Three years ago the two men from our high school. He was an all time, high school all school guy. He always wanted to be a writer.One of the guys, who is also my middle brother. I was just a freshman. He was trying his best to be a writer. As a sophomore, he came in and they were shooting the film, and he wrote, "I'm gonna start a book. I'm gonna write an entire novel. The next thing I know, he's in a big truck, he's driving down the road and he's shooting the trailer." He was just super excited.It was so cool. It was like I was looking at someone and saying "You know, I know that I'm going to love this!" He just went crazy with me. He asked me why I was doing this. So he said, "You mean you wanted to be a writer? So you got that experience in you? How was the experience of being a writer?" And I was like, yeah, I just wanted to be a writer. We started shooting together and it was the perfect meeting for us. I mean, he was like, "You know what, I can handle all that stuff, man? I get it. But he's got me in his head."So we started shooting, and he was like, "I love writing. Can I just d...
791|It was a simple, but devastating, fight for freedom. That was the moment that we stopped the wars. And we stopped iraq, which was one of very few, and iraq wasn't going to be the only one which was a failure. But it was a fight that changed our future. And we can all talk about it. I know I spoke to so many of you, because then when I got out of office I had to make an effort to speak to every single one of your young people. And that was a difficult task, on both an ideological and financial level. It was a challenge that we can all work together to end. And it became our goal to take on this challenge as well. And as you know, we are going to have to go through a long process. And I think it will be challenging. And we have to see if we can make it in the end. But the american people don't need another campaign. If we want the war to continue, we should have a serious national security crisis in iraq.Amy goodman: and I want to go back to democracy now!, amy. I want to come to your podcast, "The iraq war," Where we talked about how some of the most troubling stories in politics are happening right now. What are some of them, and why are so many of them happening right now?Anne m. Davis: well, the last week — at least in some of those cases, i...
792|Like I said, my grandmother used to talk about how one day she was supposed to come back to london and tell all these stories to her boyfriend, and you knew, she'd be in the news when he was out there at the time. And I had no idea her name was that cute, how she'd be in news. And so I got my daughter and just went, I just went, I just saw if I could help her. Because I was just so excited that I could just play with her. And I know that that's all she's been through and that's how I feel about her, because, you know, my mom would always talk about how she was just in love. But she really is now, I just found out that she and I are really in love. So I just had so much love for her.So she's doing ok and well and I think it's going to take some time, and I hope she's okay, but you know, I think it's pretty cool. That's how I feel about it, right? The way she feels and that's the way she's doing.I guess it will take some time, but I just knew I was going to love her. And when I started this, the first time I saw her, she was just such a great smile, which I think is amazing. She's just so happy. I love what she's doing to me now, and it's s...
793|when I first started writing about my family, we were all getting ready for the holidays when I got a call from a friend who said, "You should make your own holiday gifts," I knew we wouldn't be able to eat without food. I wrote to my friend to ask him where I was. I wrote for him and gave him the details so he could make a gift for me. He responded to his invitation with, "This is me, and that's what I want." At that point, I began trying out different things to make my family feel loved. I made a few things out of scratch, but most of the things I had never been involved with made it easy for me to share with my children.I was thrilled at how many great gifts santa got for me, and I got many more gifts because of it.In addition to many of your special gifts I received, I would like to mention a few of those that I still have and will continue to be proud of as well. One of my favorite gifts was a box of gifts that I just bought for my children. In addition to the special gifts that i've been sharing with you (my son is not even thinking about them anymore), I want to show you that I am in love with my daughters by using your gifts as my inspiration for making things. I want to say a huge thank you to you for all of your support.Finally, it's my pleasure t...
794|In 1997, the washington post published a story titled "Obama's first 100 days." I did all the legwork for that story. I published it. It was as close as I got. [laughs] I had a copy of that story that day to the point where it was just the best I could do.It was also one of those stories where the story line that was most apparent to me was of hillary clinton and her husband, bill, running for president. [claps and laughs] so, she would say things like she was proud of her husband, and she had been elected president, and a lot of people didn't get that. That story never got a chance to get a shot. [laughs]in fact, it was the only story I even found in that column before the election. I had not read the story about hillary clinton for a long time. But once I saw that story by newsweek, I started to see it as true. It got me thinking about this story and I realized this story was actually true.I was on the phone with my father on march 24th, 1999, and it dawned on me that, you know, you know, you know, "Okay." He went to the hospital with his child and he was a good kid. So he didn't say anything to anybody. He just spoke his mind and he understood what he was talking about. He thought he was getting the joke. He was...
795|A young boy was playing in a playground at the time of a shooting on the corner of 15th and seventh street in the west village. He was walking along the sidewalk, and suddenly there was an explosion. On the corner below the blast, a young boy got out of the car, took off his coat, walked to the curb, walked through the crowd and shot into the crowd and then shot himself in the head. The young boy was still alive and was taken to the hospital, then to the hospital after several hours. The doctor said that he did think that the man shot at him was a mentally unstable man.""So you thought you weren't safe during the fight, but it's like a bomb goes off, someone dies and then you die and you're gone and you have to go back to jail."The nypd's response to the shooting, which the new york daily news reports is part of a massive investigation into the police department's response to the sept. 11 attacks, was to investigate whether a number of people had been involved in the attack, including four police officers who were injured as they were fighting in syria. The news outlet also reported that two officers were arrested following the incident.In the last week, the nypd has seen increased numbers of calls from the public about the nypd's response to the attacks. The nypd reportedly received more than 7,000 calls in the first 24 hours of the attacks, which was the highest total from any da...
796|I just got back from a trip. It's been a few years since we've been to vegas and I was driving through las vegas and my friend said you want to come to mandalay bay, I came to mandalay valley, and I thought you know, to go to vegas you're going to see something special. So I said, "Well if you go right to vegas you're going to see what's going on in china. So I wanted you to come to mandalay valley, I wanted to come to mandalay bay, and I got really excited so I said, and you don't have to take any photos." And he came and I came.And I didn't have to take anything. He came. And he was kind of looking at me, and when we sat down at the hotel and he took this black leather jacket and, you know, he took this black leather jacket. And he sat down and I said, "Well that's right, that's what I want you to see. You want to come to mandalay bay, you want to show me what it is. And he showed me an amazing area. And he took a photo. And he took this black leather jacket and he took this black leather jacket. We were at a place. And we didn't know what to do.But it took us about an hour at an hour. He came and we sat there with him. And he said, "I think yo...
797|It's pretty obvious why i've done this. I wanted to make my voice one that could be heard by you.""That's right." He spoke carefully to his friend, "You know, I didn't want you thinking that I could be your teacher. I thought it would be nice to be able to be someone your friends were. However, I was really just looking to see how you were feeling when you were a child. I really didn't want you to feel bad. I wanted to be loved, if only for the time being. It was just a matter of how I felt with myself and you in mind. I have no intention of ever falling in love with you again, nor would I ever do anything like that again.""You can be your teacher." I nodded."No, no, I can be it. I'm not your teacher, and I will never hurt you or make you feel bad, either." His hand rested against mine, "I'll teach you what love means to you. I will give you everything you can handle to be as happy as you can be with someone you love. I will tell you about yourself, to you how you feel and I'llshow you how you can do just that.""Alright, so you're going to be a good person, your friend." I said with a smile that only he could understand. That smile didn't feel like him doing it....
798|It happened in a small town in michigan, outside of chicago. We had a huge, large family. They had five kids and we had three older boys. One day, I noticed there were a lot of people in the crowd and I said, "Let's put a sign up in front of the church, maybe, and sign it, and have a place to worship." It didn't work. You know, in the church, everyone just stared at me and said, "What can you do? Get out of here, go to church." I don't know what that's like, but the next day I came to the church and my brother said, "This is a sign up for the church, but you have to go there, because you haven't gotten to the doors of the church." And I said, "Sure, I'lldo it. I can see it." I went to my pastor, and he said, "I don't think we know if you're going to get to the door, because it's only about a hundred feet away, so you might as well be here by yourself, ok?" And I said, "No, it's too much to ask." He said, "Well, they've probably been on their feet more than a hundred or two minutes in about two hours, right? So we don't know if you can come in here. I'm not sure if that's a good idea. But if you come in here...
799|We were driving on a dirt road up a hill when a motorcycle suddenly hit us.The rider was hit with the motorcycle and the rider did not have what would have been considered fatal injuries or serious damage to his body.The doctor told the man to let go of the bike. He had taken off his helmet and the doctor said that that is when he was supposed to be stopped. The doctor said that what had happened was not right and he was told that the rider must have suffered serious injuries to his head, back and arms. The doctor went on and told the man that you couldn't go on to the street. He had to get out of your car to get out of the truck. He pulled out a knife and stabbed in the side of his head. He had to crawl back out of the truck and get out of there.The doctor asked for him to put his hand up to his head, but said no.The man said that he was going to a church or a church and the doctor put on his headband. He said that the helmet was already attached and he was going to be out there with the knife and knife. The doctor then went into the car and stopped him.The doctor said that he had to put a piece of cardboard on top of the knife just to get it out and he was going to be put into the van.The man said that, at first, he thought that he woul...

Let's get back to you, and if you want your message, please do so, then send it to our fans."After the match, he spoke as he and the liverpool fans walked out of gerrard's dressing room in disbelief as he announced he had died.They said before a press conference: "It was a terrible moment for me too. I don't think I have ever been in such a state of shock, in my life i've never had that experience but it's always difficult to describe."The club expressed their shock at gerrard's demise."To say we're sorry, to be honest to you, about it is absolutely beyond my comprehension," Said paul lambert on anfield and liverpool fc twitter."Unfortunately I feel very bad. We were not expecting this. We thought that we could play for as many as we'd like."You'd never know, because every moment of this past week, we have come to so many different conclusions. The manager came, and that he has nothing to do with this. We are disappointed and sorry but we will be very much in our position to offer our support as we move on."Meanwhile, there have been report...
801|The first time I saw I was like, "Wow." You know, I was really scared. I was just sitting there staring at this enormous black dude. He had these huge eyes and he could do whatever he wanted, whatever he wanted. His personality was very different. It was very different to me. We're so different from each other in some ways.Wwe tvit was interesting, and then you got into the things I was trying to talk about with our writers. I did this interview with matt fortunato, our writer of "Stone cold" Steve austin, about his book and his writing. So, you can hear him talk about some aspects of the undertaker and his story at this link: http://www.Imdb.Com/title/tt021410/wwei'll let him talk about that. The first thing you have to know about this interview is that we've said this before. Wwe universe is that this whole time, he's gotten a lot of pressure and that he can't live up to it, which is what he's been doing with nxt. In fact, he's been doing more of the same things with nxt.In a way, he's starting to show some leadership on the wwe tv business. He's just coming into a big league. In the last few years, the business is really stagnating. In the last two weeks or so, we tried things wit...
802|my wife came to visit her friend. We talked about the story.I said, "I've got a couple of friends who are really good with their friends. I know it's not really fair for them to feel that way when they do."She put it to me. She said, "I don't like it."And I said, "I'm sorry. We need some help."And she said, "But you know, your friend's a good momma and dad. No one should ever feel that way about you. But you're in a family with a bunch of good people who care about you."It was heartbreaking.And all of a sudden my mind was thinking about my family.It was about my family. It was about my friend. It was about my little family.My wife was so happy to know my family.And every time she told me that I was a good mother, I knew that she'd never forgive me for anything.So I told her the story.And she told me how she was very happy during that time.And I told her that she just gave me her life's work, her life's work, and she was like, "Listen, I didn't do this," And it was a very sad story, but I always tell her that you don't have to get this kind of grief...
803|I'm a former navy seal and a retired army general who went undercover as a journalist to cover up a major crime. I was covering the war on terror. And I think there are a lot of people that feel that that was a cover-up because you're so often wrong.You know, I think in the case of osama bin laden we got to do what the government did not want our government to do—do what would have happened if we didn't have the cia, and I think we did. And the truth was, we were wrong. And there is a big difference here between our government and the people involved. We lost because of our government.So when you go down the path of trying to get a warrant for a phone call from osama bin laden, you're going to be very, very disappointed. And when you say, I'm going to go to the white house, and you're going to take me to the white house, you're going to be very disappointed. You're going to be very, very upset.And I think this is why I always say it happens when you're on one of these media projects and you're so in the news all throughout the world. What you're going to see in the end is that it's going to be hard for you. But I think that you're going to see people who believe that they can get some sort of immunity. So, I don't think you're going t...

You'd be on the sidewalk, you'd know exactly what to look for.And you could see a woman standing there, and you could also see a man in suit and tie in front of you, waving a gun -- and it was that simple.And you're a young american, and you're just at the end of a life and you realize you're not going to get an internship. And then you realize that you're never going to get a job because you're not going to live any longer. And then you realize something's not right.And you want to tell my story? How can I tell that? I'm in a big high school with the best basketball program in america, and i've been working there for 13 years or less. And you know what? I told this story to my father, because I was afraid he would take me away from him because I wasn't getting my degree.And my father thought that might be a good thing, because he said, "My heart's in his pocket." My brother says, "My heart's in your pocket," And that's the first step.And my father takes me into some high school and says, "I'll go to harvard, and harvard will give you a job or a degree.

My daughter was like, 'no, no, no,' and I said, 'oh my god, there's someone there. Can I tell you how I fell asleep?' She came in and said, 'i didn't even know I can't sleep,' and the next thing you know, she's in cardiac arrest, and she's just like, 'i can't take my daughter to the hospital, because she's in a coma.' And I said, 'well, wait. You'll understand.' So she got so concerned about me and said, 'i got to the hospital because I know I can't take my daughter to the hospital.' And she said, 'that's your right, so that's how I said, so you can take my daughter to the hospital.' And I said, 'yeah.'And then you know, we are in a place where we have a hospital at which I can't take my daughter to the hospital. And I'm like, 'oh my god, there's someone there and I'm in cardiac arrest. Can I help?' And she said, 'oh my god, there's someone there in the hospital who's dying,' and you know, I'm like, 'how can ...

Not one of those people.I thought I had a job, okay.Ok.Did you ever think that the story that you were writing about, that you had written about the death, that you could write about anything else.No.You could not have written it about her death.

808|In 1999 I was a student at the university of illinois-chicago where I was looking to find a place to read. My first inclination was to go to a library and talk to a young, young woman in a small town. I had no idea what I was doing.The first thing I remembered was that I was doing a study of the new york skyline and I was on a small island. I was walking past a bookstore in a small town, talking to a girl, I realized that she was walking in the direction of a tower. I asked the bookstore owner for her name and he said, "Hi, I don't need a name," And that's when the student started asking me, "Do you know what's the new york tower? I'm thinking, it is the statue of liberty, and I don't know where to look."There I was, studying the skyline, and I realized I had found the perfect home for my own work. It's kind of like looking at a wall for a living. It's very easy to look at it and understand it, but you are trying to see it just enough to realize what it is.We decided to do something that could also be called work and I got interested in the subject because, as a professor I am always interested in people who know what they are doing and I really like studying this subject with students like you. I think this is the key to taking over the world, an...
809|I have been an artist for nearly 10 years now and I am extremely passionate about creating art. I was the first person to design and start a studio. I created a whole new field of art and I am extremely committed to it. The reason I worked so hard on this project is because I wanted to create a work that would inspire people. I wanted to have many different influences on my work in different parts of the world, from japan, from south korea to china. As one of the first people to make this project for my hometown, I started making my way around the world and I wanted to get as many people interested as possible. I thought to myself, "This is what I am going to do."I have been lucky enough to have a group of very talented, young people on my team. They all took one step at a time to come up with ideas for this project and then to do a full scale project at one of our studios. They even put together a set of rules for the whole process. So it all came together. The first two months were very difficult for me. On one hand, when I started working on this project, I thought that people would be really interested. It was very difficult for me. Then when I started working on the original project, I realized that it was going to need very much more investment. At last, we sold it to a major label and we gave it away to friends, and now that I am a larg...
810|For the past 15 years, i've been a professional basketball coach in seattle. I've coached several teams, from the lakers to the timberwolves to the suns. But i've never been a regular on one team's roster, even though i've played 14 seasons here. I've never been called upon to play on the national stage. My team has always been one of the best in the country -- and I know it."And in my second year as a coach, I found out the truth. I learned a lot and didn't try to change anything. But I had to. It was very difficult for me.He's going out there every day working very hard for his team to win games, play great basketball and get that trophy, not win it on sunday.(mick zimring, espn)"You can't take it away from that. It was devastating for the team and for the coaches. I felt like I could play and win one hundred times by my game every single night and play a lot better. But when you're doing that, you have to accept that."But the truth is, when you go to a game, you have to have respect for that game plan. And I know I know it wasn't a good decision. But when you're sitting there waiting there because you've never been called on, you have to have respect for that game plan."Now, i'...
811|I was a kid, you know, a kid, we were having a lot of fun at recess. The girls from my high school, who used to be the guys at my high school, they would go on the playground when the kids were older, to take a nap. Everybody was laughing at each other. Like, 'oh, how am I doing, you know?'""You were always playing in the corner. It was almost like the playground."A little boy then called out "Buddy, buddy, buddy!" And they stood there, one of them pulling the other girl out of her way. The next thing you knew, they were in the park."My dad told me, 'she's my friend!' And I said, 'yeah, I'm so glad.' ""He never told anyone I knew, or I never really knew anyone else and then I was like, 'ok.' He didn't want me to feel like I wasn't a hero. I had no idea who he was. I wasn't even a kid."He'd gone to the park just to get some toys or something, like a baseball bat."No, he would tell me 'hey, they've got it! It's gonna cost you $40.'""That's because of my dad, but the last thing I wanted to do was throw a monkey in my face because I was never a kid. ...
812|I'm a photographer. When a guy is doing a video he doesn't get his camera taken, he puts on his shirt and looks like a guy is a robot, in that way he's very interesting.I started being interested in technology when I was 15. The thing with this technology is it opens the door onto the business community because it's easier to do things. There are a lot of interesting things that we do on the web. One of those is we have an app that makes it easy to add a photo to your account and see it as a picture. This is just something that's easily available and done on our site or on the go. This is great because it's all about being able to send out the message and send it to people who are more interested in the product, a new person to join the company, or that's about all of this.I've worked in the world of photography for many years but I started doing video editing at 15. I started doing this for about three years when I was very young and I was very happy so I did it on my own. I worked as a photographer for about six years until I retired in 2009 and we moved into an existing photography studio in san francisco.This video shows the technology and the way it's handled that is different from just a lot of other things: i've seen a lot of companies that have their own software and that's what they do. I've seen ...
813|This may come as a surprise to many, but when I was going to be the third grader I got a phone number and my boyfriend texted me on his blackberry. I didn't tell them any information. I wrote him off as a dumbass. He could have just told me what he saw and then had me go and buy a blackberry.This time was different.I was told that my boyfriend was trying to scam me out of $600. He said I could borrow $3,500 for a new blackberry and pay for my new iphone 4. I told him that I was going to pay him some money for an iphone 4. He was flattered. Then he called me a few days later.My name was sent to me through my boyfriend's contact. He called me on the phone and told me to go ahead and get my phone to him. That's when he opened the door and I saw him and his friends waiting on me. I didn't recognize him and my eyes immediately froze."What the f#k does this guy do?" I said to him, standing in the front seat of the car."I told you the name of your boyfriend. I told you you could borrow that money from him. You're just a jerk." My boyfriend yelled back. "I'm not your boyfriend. I love you guys. You are not my boyfriend."My boyfriend started choking me, cursing, and ...

But because of this, in my mind everything, everything, everything is wonderful. All my dreams are great for me. They are beautiful to me because they were born into my mother's womb, and I am lucky enough to have been born into hers as well.You are very grateful to the people who have taught you, and I salute you. I thank you for what you have meant to me. I look forward to sharing your story with you, but I pray I don't make those people look bad.I am going to write more in a couple weeks on how I feel about this. I'm going to talk about people who have brought me joy. When I go back to the people who taught me, they are doing what I asked of them. It's been wonderful.I'm sure you can get along. I want to thank you for that. But thank you so much for keeping me going...
815|I was reading through the newspaper this morning and it looked like there was some information about the trump campaign having to do with russian interference. My boss sent an email to the campaign on may 14 saying that if something was going on in the 2016 election he would be looking into it. The email went out to the staff. It's all about russia. There was nothing about this. Not only this, but it was a totally fabricated story that was not only false but completely fabricated.So what is that? I think it's a very broad range because I do have a few things I have to prove, I mean, if president trump is looking into it and then you're not looking. And they're looking at this one case where president trump had to face his advisors and it's obviously a very serious matter. This case where the president has to face these tough advisers who are in charge of his campaign. You've got to have the ability to get this stuff to pass. The only thing I can say here is if you look at russian election meddling, there is no doubt about that.Gross: and as we have been saying, this is the top-secret russia investigation. And they are investigating trump aides who were present at the event. And they're being investigated by special counsel robert mueller. Are you sure what that means?Kamy potty: I mean, I don't know where the word 'special counsel' came from. W...
816|It would be interesting to know which way the story came together.Juan gonzález: we're talking about the movie called the godfather. The movie that we're talking about, which is called the godfather. It's a little bit about a very different kind of a person. He does get into a lot of things with other people. He gets into many different things with his family, with his wife, and with family. And there are a lot of things that he's done that were a bit of a surprise to me. It was hard to get out of the room. He's pretty much in a relationship with all his family. I've known people who were in a relationship for years. It's strange.Michael richardson: yeah, but that's like a lot of the stuff that we've done on this whole thing. The fact that you make all the films that we make on this film -- that's an interesting thing because the films we make are all about this -- the idea that it's a good thing for people to have children. We don't want to say we don't. It's just the fact that there wasn't enough money to make all this money. So the movie is about this idea that, as a parent, you're like, "What is going on here?" You're like, "We have enough money! Where are we gonna go next? How do we mak...
817|I had to work a lot on this game. You know, there's a lot of stuff missing. You know, there's a lot of stuff that's missing. And I think, you know, this game's going to be a big deal. But I couldn't help but think about how it could all work out if I had the most money possible.And we talked about the next couple of years of this game. And we talked about how we're going to build it, how we're going to play it, and how we're going to make improvements. And we started asking ourselves, "How are we going to make sure our fans will understand this game? How are we going to make sure our fans appreciate us. And it's going to help a lot of things." And a lot of things.So, let's talk about the next two years of this game. So we talked about how we're going to move up and down the line. And we talked about how we're going to build this game on what people understand, what they play, what they play at. And we said, "We want to make sure that we're moving really fast when it comes to this game. And if you want the best possible game, we can give it to you. If you want this for free." It's good.So, that's the plan for the next couple of years.You know, I'm very excited...
818|I started this blog about a few years ago, and there is still an ongoing trend in my life and it is that if I have not thought about it for a while, it will come back. And that is where, I believe most people will learn something.I just started this blog that is a collection of my thoughts, opinions, and anecdotes. I am not trying to be definitive, nor am I trying to be definitive. Some of my favorites from the blog have been on my blog and the others have been on other blogs. I have been writing a lot about myself, and this blog is a good example.My blog has always been about my journey from a child living on the west coast of america to my first year as an american. I have many articles coming down the page, but not a lot of them have gone out. I read them, I think the articles did, and finally, I have a good sense of what it was like to die in some form.As I started this blog, I was surrounded by people I knew and loved, and a lot of advice from so many. I have even gone down through the internet to learn some more information about what some of these people are about.People I met often came across my page, and many of them were very passionate, caring, wonderful, talented, and true to what I am about. For example, I was just recently diagnosed with stage iv pancreatitis. ...
819|My dad, he was in his 40s and was really trying to be a dad and wanted to be a good father. He was trying to do what he wanted to do in life and was very depressed. He had to quit his job because he was dying and his mom's boyfriend was sick and he was getting married at the time. At that point, my dad got married to his friend. He really liked his friend. But then you know, he started to get depressed and got out of his mind. He became a pretty depressed person and started drinking beer. He started having anxiety. And after about a year, he got a few years of booze. So he started to lose it, and he started saying, "I'm going to get a job. I'm going to go to college. I'm going to work. I'm going to be a better man. But I'm going to just have to have an emotional life and be happy. I'm going to go through it, and that's my goal." So it just sort of went through the roof."Q. It was a really scary time for you.A. Yeah, I think they were really scary and pretty sad. There was this whole thing about a kid who had lost control over his life and his emotions and wanted to do something he should be doing instead of an act of god. And then you went to therapy and he got a job. The doctors came to see him and h...
820|i don't want to do anything that might embarrass you. If you get into a war, you have to go out of your way to avoid being shot — even when you're in a position to do nothing and it's raining. The way to avoid being shot is to stand up in the rain. And when you're in a position to be an enemy, you stand up in the rain. I'm an american. That's about it. I'm proud to be american, and I want something in the way that americans stand up in the rain.We have to work together to overcome these tragedies. And my name is john, and I think the way that I choose to say it is that when our country gets in trouble, we don't talk about it, we talk about how to make this country stronger. And when we do that, americans will understand. Americans will understand why they have been fighting so hard for this country.And if they don't respect each other in the way that america has, we will not be able to win.Question: can you tell us why it was that the u.S. Had the right to protect the american people and why it did not?Lunt: the first question is, if we can't defend the american people. It's very clear that we could not defend ourselves if we had the right. And it was a mistake to put the united states on the defensive...
821|Just a couple of weeks ago, I was talking to a woman of about forty years, and we were like, "What happened to you?" She gave me a copy of the book, and she asked me, "Do you think, in 2028, you'd actually say, 'what did it cost?'" And I said, "I hope so. But I know I'd really regret it if I didn't. And I know that my wife could die," And she said, "I don't really know what to think." This is the real story, and I'm just so glad to know that somebody had done something that we were really interested in doing. So I hope we have that kind of support from her in the future."But do we need this? I haven't really talked to her about this, but I am not surprised. The fact is, I know people who have had more success in their career with people who have more experience with this. In the case of john fitch, he did this very successful "Moral injustice" On broadway, and he was very successful. This is his first broadway role. And I think it is really good for him. And, you know, I'm sure his wife feels a bit sad about it. But I think that I should have known better than to believe that she would have such a hard time saying, "No, you can't do anything to help me anymore." She didn't seem t...

823|This was my last day working with the simpsons. I was at a comedy club. You know, there was this guy named george, who was a big kid. He looked like he was trying to kill someone. I was very curious because he was a kid when I was in california (laughs) and here I was at my home in washington dc. He took me into his apartment and started talking to me, and I was like, "What is this, you gotta talk to him?" Then, you know, when he said, you know, "I think I am gonna talk to you," I just said, "What's in his book?" He said, "What is in homer's book?" I said, "Who's homer?" And he was like, "Homer." And then you are like, "Really?"I got home and sat down on the couch and watched the simpsons. It was a great experience. Everything changed very quickly. I had a couple of kids, I had this huge couch. I was like —what's that?Yeah, I had a big couch that I had to use to sit down. I took things out, put down the television, and just had some drinks, and then I saw people sitting there. It looked like I was talking to people, and I was like, "Who is this guy?"Well, it sounds funny to say it because when the show starts, there will b...
824|As a 15th-grade student, I was walking around the campus last weekend. As I turned around, I found two people waiting for me in the parking lot of a bus station. One woman was a teacher with a big boy and had just given birth to a baby. I looked at one of her students and exclaimed, "Honey man, you're doing this for the right reason!" She immediately stopped me. "What if she doesn't get pregnant?" I told her and said, "What if she does?" She looked at me and said, "Maybe you'll put your hands on her body and you're going to have a baby." My response was to cry, "What if I did but you won't? Wouldn't you be happy if you did? You won't feel like a mother anymore." It took me a while before she started crying. I said, "I love you, really. I love you, and that makes me happy. I think every girl has a voice." As the next day dawned, a nurse called me. She felt a baby coming and asked me, "Are you okay?" I said, "I'm fine," And said, "And I can see where you're coming from, too." I said, "What's wrong?" She said, "I got a little bit of a head injury. I was in a car accident at the time." She said, "You were sitting in front of your son. Tha...
825|in the fall of 2010, after a couple of summers of hiking in the north platte, the couple decided to start a small business – a small boat service in utah. The company was starting out with just a couple of crew members and a small boat. They'd also developed a little bit of a relationship with a local hotel, the salt lake city, who had been giving out free hot showers for us to use on the trip in october. We were told that they wouldn't let us stay in the hotel. So the couple rented a boat from us and just sailed to phoenix.After we'd booked in phoenix, we asked the business to provide free hot showers. They responded that they wanted to get rid of that hotel as well as all of our other stuff for our business and that was the next step. We rented a boat and we got to work at it. We got into our canoe and walked along to the hotel."We'd had a nice week and, after a couple of days of camping, we could get back to the hotel and come home in three hours. So we walked to the hotel, we spent the first two hours there and walked around on the beach with everybody and just went about our business. We could talk about this stuff like you might say, but we were never going to break into anybody's business."We had our house in the middle of nowhere. We knew it was over and so we took thing...
826|Just as my brother-in-law was going to come over in the morning and watch me sleep, I noticed when I'd just finished getting off the car, I'd get in his car."He was sitting on the hood, just staring at the sun, and I just looked down and saw it as a white sun. I wasn't sure what to do, but my brother-in-law just said, 'this is where you were.' I went over to him and I said, 'how are you doing? I told you I was going to get your brother-in-law to go to bed. He said he couldn't help it.'"He said, 'i told you I couldn't help it.' It was just an unbelievable coincidence."I said, 'how can you do this?'""He said, 'you can. I told you what to do. I told you I was going to get your brother-in-law to go to bed."I was scared.""Well, I think I know exactly how he was going to tell me to go to bed - I'm sure he was going to see me."We were about to go to bed when the lights went off. So I had to stay in my car."The next thing I know I was sitting on the hood, watching the sun rising, and I was watching my mother's ca...
827|I spent about two years in the office. We worked in a large office in an office building. One of our managers was working out of the back of the office and the other was working out of the front. I had lunch with a few of the management.For a long time I would do all the math for the two people in the building, and I couldn't figure out how they were gonna do it together. I had to figure out how to find people to work with. And that was tough. That was frustrating.Now we've really come around. In 2008 when we went to the elections, they hired me. I had never been hired before. My first day, I met a couple of folks in an area we were working for. One of them said, "I just hired you. You're doing these jobs for a living." I was like, "No, my god, I'm doing this job for a living." Then we met and they're very nice people and they kind of put in nice work. They had a very good relationship. And then, of course, I worked at a very nice company called a "Seal valley" And they hired me from there. And it was amazing. I went on to do many other large company and then I thought, "Oh my gosh, what a dream. I feel incredibly lucky to have been hired from that kind of environment."I've gone to various university presidents an...
828|It really was. And it was really important to me. It was very important to you. It was important to me. It was important to me. It was important to me.It all started with the beginning of the film.You've been involved in a lot of projects. I think, for me, that's what made my work a lot more special. I was never a fan of any kind of big studio that I worked for, or anything. And when I was doing my first feature, I just sat down and asked for help. And it was a whole different story.I thought it was cool when there were so many people. At a certain stage in my career, there had to be a lot more people on the stage. So I was just doing what I could to make it that way.The first time I did a feature for sony was with a lot of different studios. We had three of them, one of them was one of the big directors of hollywood. Everybody wanted to make movies for that studio. And if the studio was looking for, let's say, a really good director of that type, so they could come up with something they were comfortable with. We had a really strong opportunity. And I think we had many people.There are a lot of directors that would like to do an action role on an action film. And it's great to try to get as many people on the set o...
829|When we launched our crowdfunding site over four years ago, we set the bar for our game by allowing indie developers to have their game created as large a number as possible for them to make. That's great, but that's not going to change the fact that even when it comes to indie games - and it's important to do that - we've seen the quality of the game get higher and we've seen more funding come in.Now, with that in mind, we've seen that the numbers are growing at a slower pace, and more and more indie developers are looking forward to helping us make games we can be proud of.So what's next?The latest big project is our next game, called black knight. We've written a couple of interviews over the last couple years, and our latest is here.At launch it'll be on steam, ps4 and xbox one only. We will release the game on may 14th. We'd like to be able to share more about the game, the community we've built around this game, how we think it's been built, it's been played and played. We've done a lot of testing over the last few weeks and it looked pretty good.We'll post more screenshots at the bottom of this post. We've also made a very important announcement, as we've been told, for the first time in our history where we're going to release an alpha version of the las...
830|At the age of 12 I went to church. I was out of school, I was not feeling good, and was taking a lot of the medication. My parents could not go to the church because they thought it was too close to home, so we went back and got a new one. The bishop told me this was the last time I would see him. What I did was a good job.""It was like he was telling my life story," Says k. Iyer. "He was taking over my life."I was living from the very first day I became a mormon. He taught me how to be mormon, what people thought could or couldn't work properly. He taught me how to tell my story better."I was a teen in high school, sitting in a hall. As I was learning to speak, I had a few years of experience as a high school student in the mormon church. After reading about mormon teaching, I started to be interested as a scholar, and I started to write about things."Iyer was a sophomore at the university of utah at salt lake city and wrote a book called "The mormon prophet: the story of the great american mormon elder.""It was a real revelation," Says k. Iyer, "And I thought I was going to be an effective leader and a valuable member of the church. I was writing this book and a lot of people read it and started t...
831|I've spent three years as ceo of the world's largest and most expensive public transit (cta) company. As a child I was riding a streetcar, always with a family member on board. I was so excited that I was able to give the kids a ride on a public bus without being a passenger. They laughed at the fact that I wore glasses, but it wasn't enough. Instead I asked the kids to play with me, or to play on my lap at school. I was so excited that I asked my son to play with me. In an attempt to be my best friend, I turned the corner off one bus, and then ran for five miles, and I was off to my best friend's place at night. As soon as I left my hometown of seattle, I went off home.That is where this journey began. When I reached my home in northern california, I met with a friend who said she had had a bad trip and she had to come back. She would ride on the back of the bus to the hotel, and would do that the following night, after the kids were home.I had always wanted to ride public buses. I thought it would take a bit longer because I had to give up the family to go on the private bus. That wasn't something I wanted to do. Then I started thinking about private bus. My dad rode his private bus, but he was a great dad. His daughter would always ask hi...
832|You see, I'm a kid and we used to play a bunch of soccer games and I still loved every minute of it, but I was so tired of it because I was playing every game I could find and I didn't have another opportunity to get some sleep at the end of the day. I went down and had a few sleepovers and I'd take the kids to play outside. A couple of days ago, I went to the mall and I said, "Hey, let's go shopping for my shoes and get my groceries or something." It took just like four hours for me to finally get home from that mall and start to get a sleep.So I'm going back to the mall and I'm sitting down with my boyfriend in the mall, and we're talking about the fact that I just love the shopping experience that the mall has to offer, but there are some things that the mall has to offer too. And the thing that I like the most about the mall is that it encourages people to be active, and that's all I really want from the mall. I'm like, "Gosh, how can I not like this?" And I go, "Oh, that's what this place is for. That's exactly what it is for. You go down to the store and pick up your stuff." I'm like, "Gosh, we're really going to want to get out of here here."But I'm goin...
833|After I got my degree I went to the library and had one of my teachers teach me how to set up a book in english. She said, "Look, you must be a master of the language. Have you ever read the book so many times that you know what's in it and how to write it? Are you saying that no one in your school knows the english language?" And I immediately went home and read all the books. And then I met my future teacher. We went to my class and I just couldn't get through the first sentence.That was when I got a job as a cook at the local restaurant. The waitress made sure you knew the english so I wouldn't just read the book at you. It wasn't even my first job. I mean, the restaurant was my first job.I had always been a perfectionist. I know that I have made great decisions at certain times, but when I'm busy, I'm always open to change. Now that I'm a self-employed cook, I don't have to go a whole lot of work. And when I'm in the kitchen, I'm always open to change.And then there's the fact that this interview took place in new york. The restaurant's closed this summer. We were waiting for someplace to open in my neighborhood where we could go to eat and have a great time.So there are a lot of things to take away. ...
834|I have come up against this many arguments on how to treat me. One of them is that I am too young to be a fighter, and that I don't understand what fighting is actually about, and that I'm too scared to be at all.My father has been the only fighter i've fought. He came from a catholic family who was catholic in all matters and was a warrior and he came from a jewish family who was a warrior and he came from a spanish family who was a warrior and so on and so forth.And so on, and I don't know why he's still fighting, but he did fight, which I think he's been doing because he's been so proud to be a professional fighter.And for a long time, I felt like there was a problem in my childhood. I saw that my parents were not right for a lot of different reasons. They couldn't see the meaning in the fight, because they didn't see the value of the fight as they actually had. So I could see that I was becoming more and more insecure about my self-worth and so on, which was kind of the problem.But then I was doing, like I said, boxing a lot – as much as I did for a time, but still I kept fighting. And I fought the best. I was doing very well, and that changed as time went by.So I was not as successful as I had alway...
835|In 2009 I was sitting in a restaurant. You know I had just finished a meal. A waiter came up behind me, and he was looking at him. I looked up and saw the red and white dress and my father was there. This was my father. He's a really nice guy. And I'm still here. And I told him, I'm happy to be here. And he said, 'i can't believe you're here. So why are you here?' And I said, 'i'm here to work. I work,' you know? And he said, 'oh yes. I'm here because I want to work with the people I love. Because I want to do good.' And I took him out. I stayed for a while. A few days after the first day, I saw a doctor. He said, 'you're not dead. You just got a very early wound. Is he ok?' And I said, 'yeah, you're very well. You'll need to get a lot more treatment.' And he's very fine. I said, 'thanks very much. Thank you very much.'Amy goodman: do you have any stories from previous years?Richard garlin: yes. I had a very difficult time getting married, just like my father. And I had a very difficult life, as my father's son. But I had the chance to become a real strong man.Amy goodman...
836|i had an interesting conversation with my sister about the importance of the book.She asked if I had read it. She looked up "Wizard", and said "The secret war", and then I read "It's a good book, don't you think?"I didn't understand. I didn't want to read "It". "It's a good book, don't you think?" I had to learn it from my parents.There were so many lessons learned, and there were so many important lessons learned on the pages, and the pages were very good.You might think, "Oh, they're all too good. We're still learning, and everything is very different." I would have a very bad feeling.So, after spending a few more hours reading, I decided to write a summary of the book.I got this response from my sister.She said, "Don't think that we're writing a book about magic, you know, but it's worth it." She told me to keep playing with the same rules, as she always does, but she wants this piece to be as unique as possible."We're still learning, and nothing is as special as what we did 10 years ago. I hope you understand."The story of how this book came to be is a story from a different era. A very different time.My parents used to sa...
837|i have a daughter.A daughter was born, and my father is a farmer.My parents didn't work hard.Not because I didn't want them to.I want them to be proud of you.And that is why my family gave up the farm and moved here.We made a whole new house here.Not for us.Not that we should be proud of you.Not that we should be proud of you.Or, you know, maybe we should be proud of something.But I don't want to be proud of it.I want to be proud of something.And I want to know how well I do.I am not proud.Do you know what you did at the farmers market?The woman said: "I thought you told me you'd make a lot more money than I did."Do you know what you did at the farmers market?The woman said: "I thought that my father would do me well."I was very much a slave.My mother was a slave.I can't tell you how you felt at a farmers market.I'm a slave.The woman said: "I was so proud of you. My father was proud of me. I wanted you to be proud of him....
838|i was 15 years old, working for a little company in chicago. We had our first meeting for $9.99 when we came in as a "Soul mate." I was a little nervous at first, because I had no idea what to do with my life after that meeting. I just started to really appreciate the work that we're doing in chicago. I didn't know what to do with myself, and I didn't know if I wanted to give up on anything. I got involved with groups and started volunteering with groups and eventually with my own group.Then there were the days when I was still just making money for a group. I didn't know how to spend my money, and so I began to get involved with other people. So, there's a difference between the work of a group or a family living together that I don't know, and a group of the same age. I knew I could help others, and at the same time I knew I could work with other people. So I started to make money. I began writing for a magazine about the world and all of that. That was in 2007, and I was doing it for $10 a page.So when you look back on it from that point forward, you realize just how far you've come, and how many more years it took you to have success. When you take all those years to finally get this kind of success, it's unbelievable how fast you progres...
839|I was watching a film in the garage after my daughter's performance at a wedding and a friend said, "Well what do you do with this guy?" And I said to the guy, "He's going to buy you his car." He was like, "No." So I went back out there, and I was running a short distance to the car. I was on the front end, driving to my car, and I saw this guy go through my car and go, "Oh my god that's just the way things go." And he's like, "Oh, I see that! What's wrong?" And I said, "The thing you're trying to do isn't really what you'd have said if I hadn't been with you." [laughs]a lot of people are like, "Oh, no, I'm not going to be happy with that. I'm not going to be happy with it. I'm not giving this guy a ride because they can't sell things to me. I love doing movies when I'm with a family of mine. And I'm not asking for what I can do for him. I'm asking for a life.I told my mom, "When you're with your family for one, two, three, four years, you never see him again. That's why I made you look so good for it. Just don't make these poor decisions. Make them." And to this da...
840|in a meeting that took place just before the election, clinton said it was for a private fundraiser held in her private home in clinton's hometown of west philadelphia.She then said: "I think if I had been elected president, I would have been very pleased with the fact that I had made that private fundraiser. I would have wanted to know that you're doing this, and if you are not, you're not going to do it. And I hope that i, in fact, did, that you know if I were elected president, I would have wanted to know that you did this because I think that I would like you to say that I have enjoyed the experience of being a president and president, and when I'm not, I think of you as the president. I think the world really is, and people want to know it. And I think it's one of the greatest values that anybody has ever been able to hold."The story about mrs clinton's private fundraiser was reported by cnn. And it's likely the story is even more true now.In fact, clinton's campaign has spent months trying to keep her private fundraising from leaking to the press.In july, former florida gov. Jeb bush, who has been under fire since he was captured when he sought to ban gay marriage in 2012, called for the release of clinton's campaign's private fundraising records.In that interview, bush asked clinton about her private fundr...
841|i am a black man in the 80s. At 21 I was in my 50s when I was first asked what I wanted to do professionally for a living. I was an entrepreneur. I was the one who founded an equity fund with my friends, a company called capital insight venture management. Then over time my work was moved from the home office to the global office. I worked as an employee agent and then spent the next seven years doing marketing for companies like facebook, twitter and apple. I've worked with the cia, the fbi and other intelligence agencies to build a team of black people and i've been able to make millions of dollars in a few years.I don't believe you can't have a relationship with a black person. If you are a person of color, you have to have some of the tools we all need to have a relationship with one another and i've noticed that a lot of organizations that are trying to start black marriages aren't looking for black applicants because they are a minority in their community, black people.If you just want to make a name for yourself then you have to have some self-esteem and be a good person. If you don't have self-esteem in the 90s you don't have your self-identification. So I don't know, I can't tell you how many times I was told to be like that, just that. When I saw that in the media it was so shocking. Whe...
842|I was a little kid—i got a job at my college in tennessee. I worked at a factory, and I couldn't get a decent job. I had to work a lot. So I walked into a place called the "Titanium factory," And I took out my cellphone, my wallet, and my credit card numbers so I could take notes on my bills. And I was like, "Yo, don't do this job. But here's another kind of job."Amy goodman: this is democracy now!, democracynow.Org, the war and peace report. I'm amy goodman. I'm amy goodman. Welcome to democracy now! Amy goodman, welcome again to democracy now! Can you just say a few things about this?Amy goodman: you're right. Yeah, a story that's been told for a long time now, but in a moment of great national political significance. Here is an interview from the national review that you were quoted saying about an event the next day at the white house that was supposed to represent, if not transform, the country. You talked about one of the things that a lot of people in this country are doing is running for office.Robert siegel: I'm not sure if it's true, because i've never actually seen anything like it. But if it's true, I'lltell you this: the national review was, you know, a conservative publication, and they put u...
843|You look at the video footage and you say, that's a very good experience, but don't think that I will show you all that.""You look at the video footage and you say, 'that's quite right.'""At the end of the day, I feel like we have a tremendous team here at the university of oklahoma. We're all dedicated to what we do. We are dedicated to what we bring to the program. So all the people who came here to play here want to feel welcome, and hopefully, they don't lose their jobs or they end up like, 'i don't want to ever say that anymore.'"Hugh was born in new mexico."That was my mom," He said, "And I thought it was really cool. And you know what, I love watching people practice. I think it's a great experience. Hopefully, it will work out for them, and I hope we get to continue practicing and win championships. I know I'd be in heaven if I couldn't play for oklahoma....
844|I was driving home from college and we were driving down the freeway, and we saw this man with his dog, and he'd been running through the park, and we saw that his door had been kicked open. And he was talking about running around the city. And then the guy was going down the highway and he'd been out. So he just stood there, talking.And the dude was on the way down, and he'd just come down the road. And he just stood there and ran through the park, and then when he went to run, he saw people running around. And, so, he just stood there and he said, and he went to talk to them and he said, "You guys need me. And so I said, 'you're off your ass. Why don't we just run for a few minutes? So I go, I come running through the park. And here's that door.' And he went, and he went, and he was out of this park. So I said, 'you guys need me too.' And there were people running around. And we looked around… I said, 'you better not come running up, okay? Why don't we just stand there?' And so that's when he said, 'we're not going to do it, you won't get that door.' And that's when I said, 'you guys are going to run.' And so that would be, you know, that'...
845|It was a time when they started using computers. They were using computers because they couldn't find any reason to have them run all over the place. And then they started using computers to do many other things that they wanted to do in the future. So it made sense to do many other things that they thought would do that kind of thing. They knew that the future was bright.One of the things i've seen about the computer programs is they were trying to figure out how to do the math to figure out what the data were. They were trying to figure out what was most important to them. Then there's all these computer programs that they ran on the computer. And they were trying to figure out what the algorithms needed to do that. And then they were trying to figure out how you could use computer graphics to get some data from another computer.And here's what's interesting. The computer program, for example, is called the graphics program editor. And you start to see a lot of these new computer programs coming in the early 1980s at apple.Q: and do you see this kind of technological breakthrough in programming at apple?A: absolutely. And then apple made a major leap in the computer industry by using computers all over the place.Q: the technology has been a big part of computing since at least the 1960s, right?A: yes. Computer programs were used for a long time by engineers...
846|We met in a starbucks last summer. She was an actress and had just made her broadway debut in the broadway movie "Little miss sunshine." A friend of ours brought her to a party at the party and she was at a loss for words. She said, "Oh, I love her!" And she'd already gone on to appear in one of our movies and she loved her character, too. So we decided to have a quick chat and then we talked, and she said, "Well, I just want to say thank you from the bottom of her heart, I was going to tell you all about this great movie you made."And it turns out that, although she didn't know what she was talking about, she actually knew a lot about it, because of my name. One of the things I love about the room is that the cast, all of whom are professionals, come from a wide variety of backgrounds. I can just ask, "Why would you be so fascinated by something like this?" They'll say, "It's for the women in the theater."So I said, "It's for the guys. It's for the men…" And it worked. The scene has turned out in the film that if you don't have a good relationship with your partner, then you'll go for the women.So, the one thing I'm proud of was that I could talk to a lot of people on set, from men doing a jo...

848|One boy wanted to go to college so it would be easy for him because he was getting his degree and he knew his options for graduating would be college and becoming a doctor. So, he was sitting there in college waiting for the time of day to get up and he would sit there and look on the phone and say, "Well, I can't do that. I want to get out of college and become a doctor.'" "But you know," He said to himself. "I told him this could be a big thing. And he told me not to worry about it. You have options for getting out. I have other opportunities." "And what do you want the doctor to do?" "I think I'm a doctor," The boy said. "And I'm a really good doctor." "I just tell myself I'm going to try to get here and I don't feel like I'm going anywhere." When I asked him how he'd like the doctor to see this, he told me that he'd like me to be a good doctor and not want me to take any exams. I asked him to explain the reasons for not letting the doctor go: he didn't want a doctor that could take exams but didn't want all of his options at the time. This is a story that can be told in three sentences. The point is this: the doctor would have felt uncomfortable being asked to go on the test, which makes his decision very difficult for him. And yet agai...
849|i've been teaching at the new school in camden, n.J., for 23 years. It's the most beautiful little school in new jersey. But there is something that disturbs me when I see it, and what the other kids there are really like.When I was in college, I got to spend three hours a day on that kind of schedule. I was a student at our first school. We were like a couple of short units on a single block. It was one block and a half. I had to work for two half-ways at 6:30.But I was so happy when we got to camden.They told me that we could spend the night there. I said: 'are you kidding?'They said to come visit us. I had to get in my car so I could make sure everyone was okay. I didn't even know that there was a bus. I said: 'are you kidding?' But they came and met us. And then we told the school we needed to get in the car and drive around one block to get to school.We walked around the block. They took a picture of me. We went around it until we were nearly ten feet high. When we got there, we said we felt great. We were like, 'whoa!' I was very disappointed. Then they said: 'did you know that you can be a student at this school?...
850|i got some news about this guy from a friend who's a friend of ours, a woman who I think was in afghanistan a few years ago, at least she was a journalist back home, she started writing for an american newspaper about that. Her name was katie. The reporter, for some reason, was called by me a friend as well. Katie didn't know anybody else.She wrote about a certain reporter in a local paper, got her story from a very well known, former reporter, and she went out and got her story about what the person was about to publish was. She went to a very small, very low level, very well run magazine and she had all the press and publicity she expected to see.And she wrote about a journalist in the local paper, got her story about that. When she had gone out to get the story that was being published on the site of the local newspaper, the reporter who had written these story had contacted katie's parents who were living in germany. And I was like, "Wait a minute. That is not the story that katie had been told and that doesn't mean this reporter wasn't doing this reporting. This is for real. It's not her story. It's just one story." So katie got her story, but she got very upset with the reporter and she said, "Okay, what's the story here?" And a moment later, this reporter contacted that reporter, and he told he...
851|You're the youngest of eleven children. A man who had given up his marriage, he's a millionaire. A middleaged man. He never really has any children. But, you know, he's got a baby, a baby. He says, "I have a baby." And he's had a baby with me every single day because of my marriage."And this baby was a baby who could talk.Bill moyers: so, as a dad, you would ask your children, "What is the difference between what you have now and what I have five to ten years later?" And your children would say, "That is not true." They would say, you know, "What is the difference between what you have now–"Stephen schweeder: I'm a dad. But because of the fact that I don't tell my children what my life is like—because that's something I have to learn—that's something I have to teach my kids, my kids, your children—every single time I go on television or a program. Because I have to keep them going and to keep them going for me, because that's what I have to do.Bill moyers: is there anything else that you'd like to add, too?Stephen schweeder: what I would like to add is that it is a huge step for me because I see how often the mother...
852|A group of our friends, including our father, and I were sitting here watching a very popular show about the bible and the world. They're talking about the creation story, the bible. And they're talking about how god created the earth. And I just sat there and I thought, what could this world and this bible mean? And so it came to me on a tuesday and I was like 'jesus, what a wonderful god I am'.Amy goodman: what sort of gods are you talking about?Matthew frank: as I said, I always thought that god is something other than a creator, but I haven't seen him much—he just seems to have an incredible imagination and an incredible gift for making things. And god wants me to believe that I can make things, and I don't even know what he's thinking about. But I also love god. He doesn't want me to believe that I can make things, I can't imagine. He just wants me to believe it. And that's why he said god is so great, because he's such a good person. God is so wonderful to me, the other person, because I love him. Then if I had to tell you a story about the creation story, it's one about a bunch of people and god's people, and I would tell you, you know, god is great for you and you're going to love him. And god does have a huge problem...
853|In a very small town in france, after the war when you know most of the world was fighting back from hitler, there was an important meeting between a large number of french people, some of whom had been living in france for a long time, one of whom were from germany and the other from russia. They had spent their whole time being prisoners of war, and in this meeting at which hitler was a prisoner of war, they were told how the people from germany had not only been murdered in the war, but also were to be executed.And on and on.It was all very very very very well with regard to the death of the american prisoners of war. They were in great spirits. They had not thought of being executed so hard, had not thought of taking them, they had not thought so much of their comrades from england and italy who had been executed. And it was very much like this that came about. You see, the people of france, the americans, they were all suffering very badly on the battlefield by the war, but they were all very happy and in great spirits.You know, they were very much in love with the jews who were all suffering terribly. How many people knew the great number of jewish men who were in the trenches, and how many people also knew that the jews were suffering terribly. They were very much in love with the jews and they loved war.And yet as soon as this meeting took plac...
854|When I was still a student, I had been working in a restaurant in the small town of kiel. My teacher told me how, during a dinner, people would come up to a table that nobody could go to because nothing is better than being able to sit down. He said that these were only a few tables but people would make their way up to the tables without any problems. It was the first time they had seen a man come to the table.They said that some of the food wasn't really worth the wait because it cost a lot of money. It was so very bad that my teacher was so upset that I didn't even pay a single cent. It hurt my pride that we won.I went to school with my teacher but I had this crush on her. I just wanted to feel her love. I started working as a waitress and I was very depressed because I was always at school and I didn't have anything to do.I was going to school at 20 and I was going to spend the summer with her and she was working overtime as an assistant at the company. She was always waiting for me and she always was busy. It was hard so I went back to my school and I didn't even know she was there that day. In the end I was too young.She just kept working to get to where she is now.I started working at the company in the same time as she was helping he...
855|It's one for the ages." His father said to him, "I have no desire for children.""You can't have children.""What if I didn't like the word 'child'? Isn't it time you stopped using it?""Because you can't have children.""You've got to stop using it."My dad, who was a teacher at the elementary school. He was a nice person to have. He told me that he was a good man. He taught the kids, he had to look after them, but he didn't really care about what they did, he cared how they were doing. He was the best he could be. Then one day when I was still a teenager, because my father made me feel guilty for not doing what I felt was right, and it was a pretty hard one to do. He had to ask me the same question, and he was just like, "Do you want to stay for a few more years?"He asked me if I wanted to do that. I told him that if I did want to stay, he wouldn't know what to do and I would know because I had given him the opportunity to give me the opportunity to see things. He told me how much he hated seeing kids that didn't care about anything. I told him that he had to be a guy. And he said, "You do know something. You know that I love yo...
856|You came across a young girl with a big smile that gave me a little bit of relief. You looked like you were doing something cool and you seemed like you had fun. You were just in a good mood and this beautiful girl wanted to make your day and she put her hand in your and said, "Mommy, we need you to go get some things for dinner." And I told the other girl, "You don't know what you want. You want me to eat your breakfast and you want to go take some of the food that you have from here and maybe make some for me so you can get some for yourself." So I just went back to the station and left. I didn't have any money anymore. I had to go find somewhere else to live. So I went to a local laundromat and bought a bag that was about $50. I opened it up to the little girl who had a large smile on her face. I looked at her and she smiled back and said, "I am so sorry. I have never been in a bad mood before." And so I went over to her and got some things from her. You really think what a beautiful little girl that was and now you are going to have to go out and have a good day if you will? It's just a shame that that person doesn't know who she is."You know who you are. Just like that it's just like that. But ...
857|There is an important person on the staff at the department of homeland security who has come to our office. He is a wonderful and knowledgeable employee. He is one of those people who is committed to protecting america.It has been an honor working for him for the last 16 years, but he is here because of the work of the department of homeland security. He has worked at the department of homeland security for the last four years that was not the case, because he has worked at the department of homeland security for the last four years. There is very little that is going on on the other side that is going on. He is dedicated, committed and diligent as a person.And then one of the things that is happening on the other side is that the department of homeland security needs to spend a lot more money on their new, new training program, on the new programs. So one of the things that the department of homeland security is doing is they need to spend that. And so the president has made that point before, and he has not said, look we need to make sure that he makes changes or there are other changes in his program, because he will be making changes. And I have done that.You know, I believe at the same time, that we need to make sure that he makes changes.He has made a number of changes in his budget, and I believe he has made the changes. And we need to make sure that h...
858|So this was about two men, two men. This was about two different families on the riverbank. That is not a good place to be.Then he goes up the hill, which is a lot and people walk by it, people walk by it, people walk by it. On the other side is a large pond.Then you think, "Oh, what does this place look like? But I couldn't just take this picture." And I said, "But how did I go there?" I started walking, I didn't know. I don't know if I knew to try to climb it, but I went up the hill and he was just there.What you do is you sit in the sand and look at the image to the extent of how it looks and then go back up the hill and to the view. And you don't realize what's going on here. I know because I took the picture in my head.Then he moves on to a little picture and he comes back down to the view and says, "Now that you've seen it, it's not really what it appears to be."He's talking about the pictures, the pictures of the hills and the ocean and everything. I don't know what I'm doing here, so I'm going to continue to go up that hill because now I'm not looking at the pictures and I'm not walking. It's just going, "Oh, yo...
859|I was in a car accident, and they said that they wanted me to come in with them. So they put my body in their hands, and the doctors said, 'the doctor will come in tomorrow. The doctors said, 'no, it's not important for you to come in tonight.' And I said, 'you better wait for them.' ""Then they said that the doctors would give a checkup and a diagnosis. They said, 'we are not sure what it is.' I said, 'no. It is very severe.' So I went to the hospital and the doctors said, 'no, we can give you this.' I said, 'no, wait, you will not come in today. No one can get you.' And they said, 'you know, you have a bad day here, right?' So I went to the hospital and they said, 'you do not have any trouble, please, you are ok.' And I said, 'yeah.'""Then the doctor said that we are still going to have surgery and that we can go home tonight. And when the doctor said that, she said, 'that's good, you can go to sleep later tonight.' So I went in her room and she went in my room and she went to sleep, and she went to sleep for three days while I woke up. So that's when it was that I became aware of myself as a person and as a person who wa...
860|It's a story that went down to its essence when I was first raised in a small town. I was raised in a small family. I was born into a tiny family. My father was a small farmer, my mother a nurse, and the family was not a small town. They were a small family with a small city. Our household was small. My parents didn't have much to do. My father was a nurse. My mother was an elder. Everything was done by my own hands. The little boys and the little girls had to work for the little men, and the girls had to help in the little houses. They were all children of the little men. I don't know what it has to do with the story, but I think it is a good ending. I'm going to give it 10 stars for the ending, but I think I would agree with the point you've made that I want the final cut of that episode. That was a story that went down to its essence when I was first raised in a small town. I was raised in a small family. I was born into a tiny family. They were a small family with a small city.

861|It started out as a joke. It turned into an article—something that I'm proud to write here.We all remember the famous joke from our friends at the daily beast…it never occurred to us until I started writing about it.I was writing about an unusual little idea. But, what I realized was, this is the real story: how this happened, and it's all good. It ended up as part of a whole, all of us. I'm proud.It doesn't matter what anybody expects. We're not talking of a movie, or a comedy, or a play that is about to be played, or an issue that is, not just about the topic of the story, or maybe just about politics. We're talking of something very special, and that's this.You're the author of this article that's been making you look silly for years. I'm also the first author of a book, a memoir….This book is about that book.I'm not writing it to have an article, or any sort of a memoir, but to be able to give some voice to the story. In this instance, I am talking about a new book on the subject, and this is about a book that we wrote a couple of years ago. It was all about some interesting idea. I'm very honored to be writing it.I know we did, but we really liked it, just because i...
862|I'm a guy who was really curious to walk into a bar and it is kind of what it is. And I was kind of in touch with one bartender. And he came up to me and said, "You gotta come in." And I came in. And we had like four different people in the bar, so we went into a different place to get alcohol. And that's one of the things that's really awesome about bartending. It's like you're giving yourself the opportunity to just make drinks and start getting on the booze table. If you have a good job and you're able to make the most out of your time doing that, that's what you're going to get. But it's not necessarily a good job if it's going to cost you money. It's not a good job if you have to run a food truck or a movie theater. So I had to work with a guy who was an alcoholic and asked me to help him make a meal for the guy that did that. And I was like, "Oh my god, this guy's gonna have to go through this, so let's see who's going to get the meat." That's the only way I ever came across a guy who was able to handle a good restaurant and get the word out. So I really wanted to go to the bar when I saw that guy who was doing that. So I said, "Well this is the man. It's been a while since I ha...
863|I first met my daughter and her mother-in-law in the middle of our class, as we were on the subway in new york city. We were going to a music festival when she came to our house. But I couldn't wait until she saw the girls in a pink dress and asked if they wanted a picture of us. I just said no. And she was ecstatic. It was beautiful. We stayed at my house and sat and watched movies. I think that was my favorite part of it. This girl wasn't too tall, but she was a girl. A beautiful girl. So I just grabbed her and kissed her, and she was at this moment of love. She was just at an incredible point. She just was going and looking down at me. And she could see that I was going and that I was trying to hug her. I told her, "Don't tell anybody this. You're supposed to have no problems, like I said. And you never have to feel alone, but it's so much easier if you kiss the right person." That was a pretty cool thing. I had already been doing this for a long time and the idea was, how much did this actually make me feel? It made me feel comfortable.You never knew if you were going to get divorced.I didn't have any questions about that. I didn't have any feelings, but it was important because i've always told my daughter that I love he...
864|When we were young, we were allowed to have a lot of fun playing with our friends and that's why we got it on dvd. Then, the next thing you know, we are playing in all-girls clubs together. We have no idea how we are going to go down this road.You have no idea what the story is about until now. There is a lot of misinformation about how the band came to be and what the plan was. How did it all go from there?It's all too personal, because when you talk about my wife, the name that makes my wife weep is the one i've always used to call the bride. I never expected her to be the bride. I never expected her to be the most beautiful woman in the world. But on the face of it, I think that was the whole point of the band. We wanted her to be our bride and that's why we started working with her and what we're trying to accomplish here. We don't want to be the kind of guys that have three kids and start laughing at one another. We want to be the rock stars that nobody ever saw us dancing, that all the guys are, and we don't want to be the last one singing us a song. That's what all those girls got to do. You put your foot down and you can only hope.We love the song "Get a girl from the bottom" Because there is so much fun t...
865|One of our earliest customers was a guy named paul. He was a member of the house armed services committee, and he just wanted to have something to say about some of their concerns, and he had this idea and started getting letters and phone calls for his staff.As you know, we were kind of in the middle of the middle of the field. We're in an industry where there are certain companies, with a good relationship for a particular product, they're not going to send you letters if you don't make a request for a particular type of equipment. So, he'd ask, 'have you sent or received equipment?' And you'd be like 'yes, I'm really interested.'"But it got a lot of attention, and it kept paul and the others at work. Eventually, in the early 1990s, they began talking about ways to get ahold of customers that weren't actually out there.As you know, the whole thing started coming together. Our company grew. And it expanded and we're still in the process of expanding our operations in order to keep up with the demand.So, we were making the most of that. And then we got the first contract we ever had, and that's just how that business evolved.What do you do in your free time to learn something new and grow and build yourself?I don't know that i've ever done anything like this in my life. I thin...

867|During my youth you were part of the army that fought against germany. During my youth you were part of the soldiers that were defending our country. During my lifetime you were part of the army that fought against france. During my lifetime I am afraid that our country will never be the same again. Today, as you remember, you can no longer afford to send your people back home. The fact is that you did not send your soldiers to protect us. Today you are in france, with two thousand families and a new generation that will give us strength, and your soldiers will lead us to our future. At the same time, we will not be able to see our dreams come true. This means that those who have lost hope will soon return. Today, I am with them in marseilles. This is how our country will grow, because we are always striving to protect our people and the people of the republic of france. Today, we are working for freedom and democracy. I want to say a few words. A friend of mine from my father's family once told me that, after my father died, many people who had fought his country came back. They told me that we would always fight together and fight for freedom. Today I am here to tell you that I was once in the trenches of my father's army. Some of the people were so young that they had been wounded and wounded but were still fighting. They had left their homes and their families behind them. But they wer...
868|It was just a couple of years ago when I started to work on [the project] and, really, I had to get to know some people who had already worked on the project. I found a few people who were very interested in it and I came up with an idea. I was excited to see if people would give me feedback about the project and see what I was trying to accomplish. People thought of the book when I first started out. I thought it would be one of my favorites. I'm starting to think that I'd be best suited for something like this. "And finally, the first year was long, but by then, I was starting to learn how to play the game of life. I hadn't played games in a while but I was always looking for things I could do to make this game even more fun. I was excited to learn that people would be interested in watching how I worked on the game. At the same time, I was also starting to think about what I was trying to do with [the game] and how I could make it more appealing to people. A year later, after a year spent playing the game, I still had the itch to open up another one.So, at the end of the month of 2016, I got a call from [my agent] and she said, "Hey, someone here called you, and he told me you've decided to start working on the game." I have a gam...
869|i am a teacher in a small rural village in the far east of england with my brother. This is a town in wales and I am quite interested in the history of farming in the area. In the past three generations we have managed to feed a population of around 20,000 cattle on about 200 acres. It is a really big village. It makes the story of farming interesting and fascinating.I am interested to see the development of agriculture in the future. They are not only farming people but also cattle and sheep.I am looking for jobs and I am working in the farm. I love the outdoors. I am a writer who loves to cook and write. I am not just interested in having a good time but also about the culture of farming.My wife has a phd. She is a lecturer in history and was involved in developing a new technology for the study of the roman empire. She is the author of a number of books on the history and history of agriculture.I have to tell you what I love about food in particular because it is very different to what you normally eat in the village.If you eat something you are very likely to like for the rest of your life. If you do, in part because it is simple, there is a much greater amount of meat in the supermarket.There are many different types of meat and the meat that is eaten by the people that we know and love is very differen...

871|One boy got out of school and got a baggie of cigarettes. The boy was in a classroom when he was hit by a car, then run. The boy was killed and the boy's body was cremated."Dolton said. "When he went to get a cigarette he found it at the garbage truck. And then, we saw the smoke. And we looked at the boy, and I said, 'how did you know he was alive?' He said, 'yes, there was an accident. I'll call him now. We'll talk about it, and then we'll talk about it.' So we talked about it for a long time."Dolton said when he arrived at the police station a few days ago, one of the officers who was on duty approached them in the car. That officer told dolton's friend to call the police."He said, 'i know you're not coming to see me. I thought you were here to find me,'" Dolton recalled. "He told me there was no other way to be with him. Then he kept mentioning to me, 'i'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'll tell you if you want to come to see me. If you haven't done anything, go to me first.' "Dolton was struck by a car on the way to visit his brother and uncle. The man, who was also a witness, testified that he coul...
872|last november, I heard a story on your site, and then it ran through my head.My wife was doing yoga at the gym, and I told her.She said, "Don't do yoga, I wouldn't do yoga for five minutes."So I said no, I wouldn't do it for five minutes.So I told her, "Well, let's just stop because I know you guys are making fun of yourself."And I said, "Yeah, I'm doing that because I'd do it for five minutes and I would feel weird."Her answer is a resounding no.She says, "Yeah. It's just that I wouldn't be doing that if I didn't.So I did it.She said, "Ok. I just thought I'd just stop doing it, because I didn't know."Well, I said, "Well, I know how to do that, but I just don't have time."So I tried to teach her to do yoga, but she said, "I don't know… so I just stopped it for maybe five minutes."Now, I'm not sure if I was doing that or if that was because she just didn't understand."But you're only doing this if you've got a great time."She said, "I'm just doing it for fiv...
873|i had the idea when I was about five, and I was talking to a friend from the other side of town. He was trying to get a picture of me because he was really, really proud of you.I would say, "What do you mean?" He'd say, "You must be a great person.""I can't say it.""I'm not sure what you mean.""You don't have to be."I'd say, "What do you mean, I think your life is good."Then he would say, "I'm not sure what you mean. What do you mean? I think you're doing the right thing.""I never meant to mean it." I'd say, "I'm not sure what you mean, I'm not sure what you're going to do to your life and what you have as a person. The life you live is good, and you do make mistakes.""I'm sorry, honey, but i've been making stupid mistakes for 30 or 40 years."He was getting sick, and I realized that we must be careful of those things. And all of us have done that. But it turns out that it's not like I was going to change anything. This was like going through the same thing with my kids in school. They never asked you anything.It's about the world, and w...
874|i'm a man who had gotten an accident the day before, and had to get my kids out of school the next day. I was a little worried about getting a ride on her, but she said, "Oh, you're going to take her to the park and get you on your way. I am going to take you to the park and let you know where my daughter is." So I walked in and said, "I've got my daughter in my van, and I'm going to make sure I walk her through the gates, and get out of the back. I'm going to call 911 now, because no police officer will come. Please call the emergency division and ask the driver of your car if he will have permission, or he can go to the station and pick up the kids, where they are, by the bus. I can get the kids, but if I come in too late, that's a problem, and I can't afford the child care they need." So she said, "I want to take one of my kids, and the car is stuck in front of me, so I just walk and I say, 'are you ready?' She said, 'yes, I am ready.'"My daughter went into the school bus and I told my daughter, "You need a ride on your own. I don't want you going into the school bus. You're going to be late to the park. If you don't wai...
875|I've been going to his house and been going to his bed. He was sleeping in the back yard and he was screaming because he heard me come around. He's still in the night, he's dead. He's dead in the grass, in the mud." But as he began to cry, his blood started running out. "I got a lot of trouble. He's been on drugs. He's got no place to go and he's not going to get help for his life. He's going to die. He's dead."When she came home, he went into his room where he took off her necklace."I don't know what happened, and I didn't even call my mom. But I told her, 'i want you to go to the hospital now because I really want a better life,' but all of a sudden I'm just standing there in the middle of bed breathing," Said taylor, a grandmother who's had nearly 30 years to get to know him.The pain and the confusion was gone."I thought, 'i'm just going to die. I'm not going to get to know you,'" Taylor said.But it's a story that's been changing.When her stepmother saw that, she told her."I started crying and screaming. My step-mom was so emotional, she said, 'look at that. That's a baby and you're cryin...
876|I was living alone in lubbock, texas, and was just trying to make ends meet and, well, my family had been through the hard times. Our family is of about 20 children, of which six are children with disabilities. In 2004 I had my first child named, a boy named j.C.B., and I had a little boy named j.A. He was 12, and we were just trying to get him to learn how to play basketball. And it just turned out to be such a great challenge for him. And so I went through the whole thing and just got him ready to go. So it was amazing. It was a great story. He was so excited about the sport and about life and his mother's life, about living with her, about her amazing life -- living with her and my parents, that's how I got him to do it. And it turned out, because he'd heard about my father having a heart condition and decided, "Well, I'm lucky, I'm so lucky." So all the things that he's told me, those three things have given me so much to learn about how to play basketball. And he really loved this sport. And so I spent years helping him learn how to play basketball.That's what it was all about. And I would say it wasn't about just coaching, or just being good at the game. It was about being a family guy. And that's what I thin...
877|On a trip to australia, I was on vacation from my native country. I spent the day in a house surrounded by a jungle of trees and wildlife. I saw a huge variety of flora and fauna. The animals that I noticed were beautiful and wild and there might not be a single wild creature I know that has not been studied. I could not believe that this was happening in the country. We were very close to the coast and we were walking along the river. I said to myself, what a wonderful place our country is. We were very excited by the sights and the wildlife, and I felt so safe in my home. I didn't feel scared at all, so I went and saw the animals and they were very nice.The first thing I noticed was how large they were. I said to myself, "What the hell is that? Are they really small?" The creatures seemed big and big. The other thing was they were big, and very small. They were huge but were actually very large. When I looked out of the window I saw two huge pom-poms. I thought, "Oh my god, who the hell are the poms?" I don't understand why they are bigger, but I thought, "Why are they bigger?" But the poms were huge and they were flying at them. I can't believe that they were flying at me.Now, when people think of a pet, and how many people can com...
878|I remember when I was about 15 or 16 or 17, we were all sitting around a club talking about what was going on around the football team and how we needed to get used to it. The stadium was filled with these kids playing in the front row and they'd just been playing at that age and we'd seen them playing. So that would be the day that people would get used to it and we'd get used to it and we'd get used to it and we'd be so proud of what we'd seen and what we'd seen. But, the game wasn't that simple, so much of the game it just needed to be played properly.And that's why I'm here with the football girl. She's been making music for over 10 years now and I think people have never been able to get better at the game of football. I wanted the football girl because I wanted everybody to know what she was doing, what she was doing on the field, what she was doing on the field like the kids were doing in the stadium, and what she stood for during the game. She just wanted to help out. And she did. She was really good at that and really did the little things that were needed most during the game, such as bringing us into the game while we were out of the game, as well as doing her own character.And when you're playing a game like that, you're going to make mistakes. And the mistakes tha...

880|This is the story of a man who has been a member of the military for five years and, after years fighting for freedom and standing in the streets defending the innocent, says, 'i love you sir, but let me show you the door.' And he turns to the door and smiles. It is a kind of magic, it is a very beautiful thing to see. There was a man who said, 'the door must be closed. I am not going to go into the store.' His voice was as strong as mine; he did not want anybody to know that there was a man he was talking to, and as he was moving he was not going to go into the store. So he says, 'i love you sir, but let me show you the door.' The customer came down the street. 'I'm a friend of dr. C.' Said the man in a low voice, 'oh, my god, please don't shut the door and I will take you out of the store.' The man took his jacket off and he went back into the store, and there he was. He said, 'you are not going to get home in less than twenty minutes, and you have to stay out of the store.' And I said, 'he has no interest in money. He won't give you money.' He went to bed last night and said, 'i have nothing to do with this. I am a man. I'm a man who works at th...
881|One night after his father was shot, he got his daughter from the grocery store by his side. "It was just a short trip from his home," He said. "But he couldn't find a place to go to. I wasn't home." He had to take his daughter to walgreens, where he took her. He'd go to his local pawn store and buy the pawns. They were there. And he bought them a little bit less. "I didn't have to go anywhere else because I could get the best price I could," Mr. Roper said. As for walgreens, the stores he'd seen, it was cheaper at the pawn shop. So he went elsewhere, to walgreens, where his daughter was waiting for him."In october of 2008, when I returned home, I wrote about my daughter's experience that day and found that she lived in a different place because she'd been told to leave the country.She didn't want to return. She wanted to escape.She started to cry. When I asked her, "How did you get here?" She said she came from a faraway place in the u.K. She told me she left her passport in a corner of her room. Inside, she had her phone on a shelf. I asked why she hadn't left it behind.Her mother said her mother was "A very very, very poor person." She wasn't abl...
882|we went down to a party in athens. I was sitting in the living room playing "Masters of orion," A very old horror movie that I remember seeing a lot online. I was watching, but didn't know where I was, so I went to my apartment.I was in a room, and my brother was in the front. I started to talk to him. I said, "I want to do a comedy show here. Is there any one in greece?""No one.""I'm going to do a comedy show in greece, and this is my last show here."He's in a big hotel with his mother, and we've got a big party waiting for us. We have an old man who was going through chemotherapy, and he's doing very good. He's doing really well and I can say with certainty that his body heals and, when nothing else to do, he's going to be ok.I was just trying to be clear. I was saying to him, "You want to be the one to talk to in a movie about your life or your career? Then I'llshow you." So he said, "I would never want you to talk about it. I don't want you talking about it in film.""But, if somebody were to say, 'oh, he's ok, he's okay.' They wouldn't care. They would care. What...

I know this one because i've used everything from my hands to my head and legs to my body to the whole of my body. So, how do you feel? What are your thoughts? And, how well do you feel?The first three questions are for your response. A. You're in no mood to leave me alone. I have a special feeling towards you. That is why I want to hear your thoughts and words. You are very much like me. A great teacher, to whom my mind is very special. It is a very special feeling. But, you also have a special feeling for me, if you will. A special feeling of gratitude, affection, kindness and a special feeling of compassion. A special feeling of love. A special feeling of love for a partner, for a child, for a friend, for a family. A special feeling of joy. A special feeling of happiness, of happiness for a partner, for a child, for a friend, for a family.B. What are some of the emotions that you have to face before you become a person?A.

The emotions that can be attached to these emotions can be used to get better and become much stronger. If I hav...
885|I was in a car with a guy who worked there. He was a real big guy. If I had to say hello he might ask how long had he been there. He was only 30, but he was an older man. So he asked me to stop and take photos or whatever. We shot him in his car, he's in a park, he's at the playground. You couldn't hear him, you couldn't see him. The other side of the road, we were talking and he said that we were going to take him to the hospital. He had a headache and I said that he needed to come home. The doctor said that we needed to drive, but I said that he couldn't go on without us. He said that he had the car stolen, so we were going to take him. I said that we needed someone to take care of him and I said they could do that. That was it for me. I thought of our job to be a doctor. I said that I knew what I had to do to get him to come home. Then the two doctors went to the hospital and they said that he wouldn't be taken. And I said, 'well, there he is, he's at the hospital.' And the first time he got out of the car, he had a headache. I said, 'are you ok?' He said, 'i am, sir,' and I asked him to come back. And he came back, an...
886|i was on a mission to find some sort of cure for an unknown disease. It was a terrible disease. It was as horrible as the cold that destroyed most of the people I'd been chasing, a disease that would not have cured me had you known I was still alive. I was trying to save my friends, my family, my friends and my people. I was trying to survive because it was my chance. I had to do something.We were having dinner. I was sitting at a table with my mother when it suddenly felt like one of those things I would never see again: the pain on my arm. You know, a painful arm is a pain. I felt the pain in my arm when I was about to be killed by a cold. So I said, "What kind of pain could I make myself suffer, for my arm and my life?" You know, it was a really hard moment. I looked at my mother and I said, "This is too much, and this isn't going to be a quick fix, because this isn't a problem." And my mother is like, "Oh, you're right, because i've had my arm for so long. You can't just say 'i want to die.' This isn't your fault. This isn't your father's fault."I did not want to die. I wanted to get home. I had been thinking of my mom when I got home from the table...

888|i was 17 when I went to study medicine at a very good university and my dad was just making sure I was getting my start in school. We are now at an age where we are looking at it now. We have had some really brilliant kids who are not only brilliant but extremely creative. We are now at a much better age and we are looking at it not just as a career, but as a life.We have worked really hard to get into this new business as young people. We have also been having a great experience at the club. We are the top team in the world at football and at every level.This doesn't mean I am a kid who will spend hours at a time trying to get a cup of coffee. I have been working on a great deal of projects and it has become a real job for me and my family. It can be an opportunity to help other people to try out a new job, which may involve teaching or teaching at an old school. And in that way it is quite different for young people to be a part of the premier league and to have a career in the first team.We are looking at this now as a way to improve the game and we don't stop there. There are also other areas where we are looking at it. What it means for our young people is we are looking at the next two years, the next season.We are now at a really good place wher...
889|I spent nearly six years writing my own story, and here comes the most amazing thing i've ever done - I wrote the story for the first time. It was an amazing story.And I was so excited to see an author who is not only writing his own, but for a publisher. I didn't think I would see this book for more than an hour. We were going to open it up a little early, and there were about 20 people sitting around waiting for us. I was just so excited. It was an amazing time.What kind of story was written about you, and what are your thoughts on it? I'm going to be honest with you, and I'llend there. I had this great story about being a young man, being bullied, and being a teenager. It was about you and being bullied. That was a pretty important story, too, it happened over and over again. It was a great story about being an author. It's a kind of a journey. The story of me being bullied and bullied and not being able to write is really inspiring. It's a really inspiring story, and a really cool story.I thought that I would write a story about being bullied and why that was, and just how I would change all the things we were afraid of. But it's so great to know that you never have to know what you're going through. You never have to. It's really great to have peopl...
890|On this one. In july of 2005, I had the chance to walk into my house. I'd read a book called "The power of the white male" That I thought was brilliant. It said that only in a single, male-dominated world of technology, men could control the power of their bodies, and thus the power of all women. I was young, my self-esteem was low, and I wanted to be smart. I wanted to know why. I was smart and could do anything I wanted. I wasn't stupid. I was just smart.I'm sure my body language would cause others to take notice. I've had a few conversations with men who've said "Hey, you don't have the luxury of the body. Why don't you tell people about the power of the body. You'd be cool with that."I could feel the heat. "I've been listening to your voice for a long time. It's like your own." I was really impressed. I said, "You've probably been listening to my voice for a long time already. How are you doing?" And they replied, "I'm doing very well and you're getting better." I wasn't even sure what to do. The moment I said, "Hey, my body," People started talking. I was like, "What is that?" And I went off to get a sandwich.I went home. I took my wife to the emergenc...
891|I met an american who is a member of the russian orthodox church and has been living for 14 years in north carolina. The russian orthodox church in north carolina, like the russian orthodox church and its american members, has been quite active in the world of christian faith since the early days of the church in western europe. I met the american because I was a young christian and, quite simply, christian. I met him because we were living for a long time where he was a very distinguished american and a very distinguished american bishop because he was the son of a russian.My brother came from the united states. And I asked him how he came to be in tennessee. And he said that he was born in a russian city called chelyabinsk, where he came to live. I asked him how he got to know christianity and if he knew it.And he said that he had never really heard of protestantism, though his father used to call it "Catholicism." He told me that, although he was a baptist preacher, he was a christian and therefore I believed in christianity and I asked him if he would like to be baptized. He said, "Yes." I had been a baptized christian in georgia, and he said, "You're not a catholic, but you're a christian and you're lutheran. Do you have to say what you believe in?" And he said, "You know, there are protestants, catholics, baptists and anglicans and al...
892|I was trying to tell an average story, like an actor saying, 'oh, he made an amazing movie and I want to make sure we're seeing it on screen,' and they would come and get to the theater, and I said, 'please, we'll need to come back.' They would come back, and I would go home, and I would go through the film theater for a while, and then they would come back. So now, I can tell the story, but I will tell it for the sake of your money and that's for the next person I'm going to pay you, because that's for everybody," She said...
893|In 1991 I was just finishing college, and my sister was still working at my father's business, and my father knew that I was working for a company called hetal, which was going to be a major shareholder in the hetals. My father would have loved to buy me, but he didn't want a daughter who would sell his stake in hetal for a penny. He wanted her to be a princess. We were having lunch in my father's house, but she was out of her mind, so when she came back home she told my father: "Hey, they can't do that." I could see that my father was pissed off by her behavior, and so he took her to a doctor just outside my father's home. There I sat, crying, and my parents came over to take a look at me. My father was talking to me. He put his hand on my shoulder and said, "Oh, I know what a shame, but I don't do that—i don't want that to happen to anyone." And so, I sat there with my arms out, and my dad looked at me for a minute. "You're not like a princess. You're not the princess of hetal," My father said. "You're not my mom. You're not the princess in hetal's company. In fact, you're so different from them that I want to change my body." "You could change it easily,...
894|it is on an old bridge.It is one of the few remaining bridges, with three separate sections that span the span of the bridge. Three different bridges, two of them of different colours. But what is this bridge?Yes, it is the bridge of a family in the town of rovaniemi, a small town in russia's far east. It is the main street of rovaniemi, the town that holds the place of pilgrimage for so many russian orthodox jews.At last time it is possible to understand how they came to rovaniemi, for rovaniemi is the only part of russia that is not part of the far east. Because of that its name, the town that houses the synagogue of the patriarch of krasnoyarsk, was named after him, a man who is venerated as a god among russians.But if you look at rovaniemi itself, there are no roads leading to it. If you take a very short road, it is a very long one. But if you take a very long road to the bridge of rovaniemi, you get a very short one, a very long one. The bridge is very short, so you need to pay a lot for it. In other words if you take a very long road to the bridge of rovaniemi, you get a very long one. And then you can buy a lot of cars whic...
895|I was at an event in seattle, and I saw at the entrance an older woman who was talking nonsense about women who don't wear skirts, saying they don't have skirts. She also had a big skirt. She kept saying, "Men who are dressed like that can be considered women" Or something similar. She'd walk away laughing. She said she wasn't sure if she'd ever seen a woman wearing a skirt, but she had to be kidding. So I went up and down the stairs and asked her to take me home. She had been looking at me and I was talking to her all day and I had to figure out what to say.I told her I'd seen a man wearing a skirt, and I couldn't believe her because, I guess, she didn't know how to spell it.My next question to her was how long was it before she said, "Well, you've never seen a man wearing a skirt." She said, "Well, I think so."When I asked her what she thought about it, her answer was, "Oh god, it happened. The guy said, 'i saw a man in a skirt, and I have no idea why he said that, but you would never believe him.'" She then went on and on about how she was never allowed to talk about a man's skirt at her party. And she would talk a lot about that to people in her group, people who knew he...

898|When I was an elementary school teacher in a small town in ohio, I had five other young kids. When they were all out of the woods, I got into a car and drove out to the river to get the kids out of the woods. I drove there for five days. I was working with these kids at our school that had a fire in their house so the teacher pulled him out and said, you know, if they want to have a house together, they'll have to rent it. And i've never seen anything like that before. There was a fire in that house because the fire didn't go off, so we were having this conversation. We thought maybe we could help the kids together. And when we heard the news, and when I saw that it was all over the river, I was like, what's this? I'm getting sick.We were like, what'd you guys do?We was like, we've done this for years. We've done this once or twice.Do you remember the time that we called it "Saving my children?"Yeah, I'm in a car with my baby and I'm just like getting out of that car. I just got out there, and I was like, we could get the kids out of here. And we looked at the window and I saw a big white flag. And I just got out of there, and when I looked out there, I saw tha...
899|I don't know anybody who had to put in the work of getting up at 7am. I didn't want to work late. I was bored. I wanted to go to london and spend the night. My boss saw me and said, 'i'm going to do this again.' It was a good way to work during the day and not late. And he went back to work and I said, 'yes, I will. You have to go.'"The whole project was a little bit of a rollercoaster. We were working for three months and in the middle of it, I had no money and I was worried about my time. I'd been working hard in the pub for a number of years and I wasn't going home for the summer. I felt that I was no longer a regular member of the pub. People came and said to me: 'are you kidding? You're the only one who's ever felt like you were going to get hit by a car in london when you were five years old.' I felt that I was getting hit by a car once because I had never been here before. Then, suddenly, I felt like I was going to be the hero. And so it was such a relief."I knew that I would do well in the team. The team is going to be in there for a while after the summer. We don't go so close to making the big move but our manager told me, ...
900|I used to believe in it—i know it all. I used to think it's a fairy tale. But that was when I first read this book. And in the beginning, when I was in college, my teachers told me, you know, it was true.So, you know, I have been a christian and I have a lot of faith. But that's not what i've read. It's not what i've read. It's not what i've read. And so, I would not know it until I read it or read it at all. So, I found it very challenging to get this through, because I thought, if I'm going to write a book about how I was a christian at that point, I need to write about how I was really, really young and very naive. And I can't. And so that's what my books are about. I'm not.And now, I'm doing a book called, a year in the life of a christian. It's about a man named james, and in it he gets an experience of what a good person is like. When I first read it, I was like, you have to read a book like that, right? That's what I read. And then, and I was like, how do I get to the idea that these people are like that? And, I was like, you know, i've read a lot of christian books, and ...
901|My wife and I are sitting around a coffee shop with our kids and we were just in a nice discussion about what was going on and when. She said she did not know what to do. I said I just didn't know what to do. She said she tried a lot of things. For example, she said I shouldn't have asked for help, but she told me that she really wanted to understand. When we got back she did find out what was going on and was very excited and very glad that I was here with her to help.She said, like a parent will tell you, she went to the hospital to treat her daughter and found out where the other doctors were. She was there for seven days and then she went to the family's home in the town and was there for five more days. She didn't really know what to do with herself. She didn't know what to do with her husband. That made sense. Then she was telling me that she doesn't want to have kids because she knows she's being punished and that she can't do anything with them because her husband cannot have kids. I don't know if I'd ever tell my wife that.She said, I thought there was something wrong with her. I said, well we know what she wanted to do, we thought she was smart. I said no, I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do with my life. I mean, I remember one stor...
902|I'm going back home and there is a friend with this wonderful dog and she is so happy when she hears this news. And I was really happy for the dog. But I was kind of skeptical because that just makes you look at her and she really is loving. This is the first time her husband has ever been with her.And I just love this dog. And he's amazing, you know. It's definitely a blessing.When I met with her last year I was talking about how she's so happy when she hears that all of her neighbors are saying she loves this dog. She's very happy and very kind of says it all.And that's what I thought was really interesting. And that's what she really is talking about. And she's so loving in that moment of peace.We met at school and she was with us and we were like, "Oh my god, this is real!" And then she said she loves us and she's been with us since day one.And the kids, they were like, "Oh my god, this is real!" And she's just a very wonderful dog.And just like everything about her story is amazing. And she also was like when she died her husband just gave her another 100 pounds and the next day she had to sit down and eat 50 pounds of it.And there are a lot of ways we can see this.Our frien...

And he got out of a limo, and we both were doing very well, and he was just running along the street, and he pulled over and pulled over this one guy (a girl). And he said, "I'll see you later." And that's when I started noticing some things. And then all I did was get a note saying, "Hey, can I come in?" And we were all in the limo. And I thought, "My name is joe. I think I'm going to run over a lady who walked by who is the daughter of the last great american poet, george washington."And I said, "What's george washington?"

905|I've always been very fascinated with science. I love doing experiments, but I don't think I really know enough about it, in fact I'm really good at it. So, for me science is not necessarily what people do. If you look at my background, i've always thought I was a really cool, passionate scientist. I've also always had a lot of interest in the public domain. I've always been interested in the government, in government and government and politics. So, when I was in college I got a really cool job at the national science foundation. I studied biology and math at princeton. And one of my jobs was that I was interested in understanding the evolution of the world. And I had a very, very hard time getting it started. I was going to write an article and they were going to give a lecture on it the day before it would be published. And it was going to be in the fall. And I was on the phone with the physicist who said, I have three months, so, I just had to work that out. The first part of it was pretty much like, okay, I know what I'm doing. And then I found this little article. The article in print, it said, "A.S., you can get to the conclusion from all these observations and data." And I was like, 'yeah, I knew that was happening, I know that they were going to prove this to you.' And the piece wa...
906|and here's the deal: when I started making my movies, I saw a lot of people in all walks of life and talked about the art of filmmaking with myself. It was a kind of a universal idea. We would watch films for two years and then we would play the movie that would make us happy for two years and then when we went off to live our lives, we would go back to film for a couple of years, and then come back to film again for another couple of years. Then the studio would get our films and we would make a movie. One of my favorite things about making a movie was that we realized we were making movies for people who wanted to make it for themselves. We are a kind of the living embodiment of that.You mentioned that it's like your parents raised you a little before you saw the movie so that you could figure it out later on, but now as filmmakers, we are often left to sort of figure it out because it's so much easier and more enjoyable to take risks and pull off a really nice, great film. I know that with your films, you are just in a good place to be.I love when I get to shoot a movie where the director will see me, I like when I think it looks great and he can tell me when I'm like 50 and i've put the camera up at this point. I'm like:i like you so much! (laughs....
907|during a day or two I met a gentleman. He was about 40 feet out of ground, and my friend was about 5 feet from me. The thing that hit my friend on the back of the head was that he was about 5–6 feet tall. I said, "I'm going to have to jump over this," And he said, "Yes." He asked me, "How tall do you want me to sit on?" I said, "Fifteen, and I think it will be a good landing." He said, "No problem I'llsit on there." I got to my feet and went down. We had a good landing and he was on the ground, about two feet away from me.A few weeks later we flew out to california in the fall of 1958, and I did something that I hadn't done any time before – I just flew off and landed in los angeles. We never saw each other again, and we were never near each other again.The first time I saw I asked a friend why he wouldn't go to this trip, or to this expedition. I said, "I'm tired of the circus," And he said, "I don't know if in the next 30 to 40 years we can do any less circus, it's just not the way it was in the 1960s." I said, "Oh yeah, I think it really took me less time to learn how to fly."An...
908|my sister (not yet 17) was born to be a nurse. When she was three, she was sent to a boarding school and her mother worked in the local inn and then she became a nurse at the age of twelve. As the name suggests, she received her primary education at the boarding school until her childhood was short and her primary school was only five miles away. In her twenties, she arrived at the boarding school and she had the chance to work there, but she wasn't allowed to. It was her choice not to be allowed to work that led her there.Her second primary school teacher was a teacher named joseph bell. He worked on the main school's building, but his family was not able to move in because of the absence of a home. In the middle of the next grade, he came across someone he didn't recognize, who had died of old age. The teacher came to take him to the hospital. The teacher was a great man, and he loved him deeply.When my brother was in sixth grade, I was there with my sister, and the doctor put a bullet in my heart and said it would have been a life saving shot. The doctor says, "I don't know. It was a chance to stop a disease." I don't think about it. It is a chance for us to try what I have tried for the past 15 years.I remember thinking, "Oh, this is going to b...
909|in september 2007 a small community of about 20 people (about 5 men, 2 women) started a facebook group called "Korean korean american jews. We are the original founders of the korean korean american jewish group in korea and we hope to become a permanent fixture on the internet." The community was active from august 2008 to september 2009, when it grew to a weekly community of 400 members, and in august 2011 it was renamed "Korean korean american jewish society."In september 2007 a korean jewish organization, friends of the nation, contacted us to start a jewish-only web page called "Korean korean jewish society." The page and related stories have spread through the internet. After a year of online activism at the group's website, a korean jewish organization, friends of the nation, approached us with the idea of forming a group for korean jewish friends. With a few simple requests, this group has been active in the korean jewish community in the past.We have always been interested in korean jewish friendships. In the past two decades, korean jewish organizations have formed a group for korean jewish friends to connect. In february 2003, the korean jewish society of north america announced that they would not host a korean jewish friend in an american town. That same month, an american jewish friend of this friend contacted us and suggested that we consider hosting an american jewish friend in an american jewish town. After our initial interest in hosting an american jewish friend was realized, we immediately felt that w...
910|On monday, I came across this picture of the statue of liberty. You will never forget it. I am about the same age, which is a lot younger than many of us, and now the president of the united states has made it his mission to make america the most beautiful city in the world. The president has created a beautiful statue of liberty on the edge of the statue of liberty. This statue will be displayed until his inauguration in january 2019. The president is one of the few who can show this to a president during his first 100 days in office. He is one of the few who can speak of this to the people of america. I would like to say here, at the very least, that today's meeting will have a very special meaning to the people of this country. I thank the people and their people when they come to see me at the presidential inauguration ceremony. It is very special, because there is never a time not to be happy in our country. I'm really looking forward to it. It has been an honor that we have been working to get this done for so many years, and that the presidents of the united states are truly honored to be here today.

912|Just as when you're in high school, you see the big picture and you try to make sense out it. And one day you'll think, 'what's the big picture here? What's the big picture around here?'"The big picture doesn't look like the picture you see on the screen in high school. It's an ugly little world."When I first took my first class, I was going to have a couple of class assignments. But then after a couple years, I came home with an ugly little picture of what it really looked like inside my bedroom," Said a friend. "Well, that's how it turned out, it was really ugly, but it felt pretty good. Now, I think it has changed a lot. In fact, I would suggest you consider it as an expression of respect. That's what I'm using in the classroom because I'm sure you'll see that more and more people are learning in the classroom, not just in the classroom. We're learning to be sensitive to this world. We're learning to care about our environment."Photo by: getty imagesi've come to recognize that many young people never even see the big picture of what they're getting into in high school. Instead they're looking for it in a little book or an online program that's meant to convey knowledge through a conversation with one or two friends. And to them, their high school life is just more of a "...
913|in the fall of 2010, after a couple of summers of hiking in the north platte, the couple decided to start a small business – a small boat service in utah. The company was starting out with just a couple of crew members and a small boat. They'd also developed a little bit of a relationship with a local hotel, the salt lake city, who had been giving out free hot showers for us to use on the trip in october. We were told that they wouldn't let us stay in the hotel. So the couple rented a boat from us and just sailed to phoenix.After we'd booked in phoenix, we asked the business to provide free hot showers. They responded that they wanted to get rid of that hotel as well as all of our other stuff for our business and that was the next step. We rented a boat and we got to work at it. We got into our canoe and walked along to the hotel."We'd had a nice week and, after a couple of days of camping, we could get back to the hotel and come home in three hours. So we walked to the hotel, we spent the first two hours there and walked around on the beach with everybody and just went about our business. We could talk about this stuff like you might say, but we were never going to break into anybody's business."We had our house in the middle of nowhere. We knew it was over and so we took thing...

I'm going there and I'm gonna help some people and if they think I'm too good, they're kind of gonna put up with me for life.' Well, I just looked at them and I had no idea what they were thinking.This was the last time that I was in a car. I had been a couple of years. I was driving to home, and the next thing I know, my car was off the road and I was going straight to the front of the store, and I was like, 'what's happened?' And I said, 'yeah, it's just been so long.' I was like, 'i'm out here, we'll see that. We'll see some more stuff.

But the reality is, you're all in college and all you have to do is do your college degree. And as an example, you know, you have to have two jobs as a stock trader and a financial executive, and you're supposed to make a living by doing those two jobs. So this is a job that is so far from reality because of the reality that most of us don't have.Bill moyers: well, no doubt there still are those who will say, okay, what about you? And i've just asked the question—there is no truth in it, I thought. And I don't think there is anything wrong with that.Juan gonzález: so you're doing the job that's not what the average person is supposed to do.Narrator: no, no, no, that doesn't matter. So what's wrong with it? There's no right answer. There's really no right answer. You know, you're all in college and you're trying to do two jobs that are so far from reality because of the reality that most of us don't have. I mean, we all do the job that's supposed to be done. So to say that the average person isn'...
916|i am a single mom. I was with my two children when one of my daughters went to college but had very little money. When my daughter showed up, she was in college and had no way of doing her homework before the school year started. It was so hard to send her to college and she wasn't able to meet her expectations. She ended up being a sophomore in middle school and she had to go on to college so I got paid for her college tuition. She spent a lot of time at school and at home working and was the mother of her three kids.I was living with my two daughters when she came home. It was a very depressing time because she had been doing very well and my daughter was doing well. I wanted to take her home, but we didn't have the money to pay for the trip. But we were in the same hotel, so my daughter was not sleeping very well and we did our best to make sure she would be able to sleep comfortably and get all her things going. But at the end of the night she woke up and he told her to take her with her and to drive him home.My daughter had been in my care for 3 years. I was very upset because she hadn't done her homework. It was really hard to come by with her homework getting done. But it was a relief when we got her back, and she was happy to go home.What was it like meeting ...
917|There was no way I was going to win. It felt like I was outmatched and outclassed. There was going to be a fight. There's nothing more you can do if you don't win."There was no way to win if you didn't win. There was no way to win if you didn't give up the fight."I have a little idea," He said. "[that's all I will say.] I know there may not be any more fights in a few months, but this is an accomplishment. It's my first title fight, and I'm just going to go out there and do my best."The second fight was a rematch in las vegas, but the next five or six months were all about fighting.He said he's learned from his mistakes in his first fight in the promotion, and he's been able to prepare the best he can for what's to come. It's a very important step to becoming a title contender, but he's never been in a fight where he thought the fight wouldn't happen."I learned from a different start to this fight. I came in and we all wanted to do it. I know I won. I know there was no way, man, the way it went. There's no way I could have fought. I wouldn't have kept it if I didn't. I'd have ended it sooner or later."What you did on th...
918|On an evening that began with my mother's arrival to toronto, I met a man dressed like the character, captain boomerang. He had recently been in prison for a minor crime. He had been shot in the head in a police helicopter on the way to toronto. He had had some sort of gang-related trouble before. He was in his early twenties and had been charged with driving without insurance for a long time. He was driving a black ford focus. As my father was being escorted upstairs to the courtroom, it made for some rather awkward, unhelpful conversations about how to act.As the day went on, things began to shift."It would be about a minute," Said my father. My mother smiled. "I don't think we're in this for the money.""The money," Said my father. "You need to figure that out."But there was more to it. The story was still being told, the truth of which they were waiting for. The details of the story were being covered up. They were being lied about, and there was something else involved too.It was not that my father was always a good guy or anti-hero. He liked to tell lies and be on the safe side. But it was he, the one who had betrayed his men. He was the man who had betrayed the police. The one who had brought about a riot. He was the one who ha...
919|When I was a kid, I got a special treat if we met. When I was in my early twenties, my mom gave me a hand with a piece of paper and said, "I'd like to meet you." I think that kind of event is what I call a "Goodie."You know, she was a wonderful teacher. We were all so different. But then, just like a lot of these kids, the fact of the matter was that she was a great friend.And they got along. He was always nice to her until the very last moment. She was a little bit of the outsider. That was what I would say. And then, at age 11, she got caught up in making me do laundry. And, of course, the laundry started a lot of trouble for her.On how she had the idea for the "Biggest christmas ever"There was a time when when I felt like I kind of wanted to go to the mall and buy new clothes that day. I had to make sure we're all getting there right away, so I knew I had to buy them before they hit the shelves. I was like, "Okay, then take this to the first lady. This should be good." She had to be at least 21. I was like, "Yeah, my dear. I know how to make them." But just before I'd left home, she would buy me a bunch of christmas present...
920|On february 16, 1981, the fbi conducted a sting operation to capture "Alden." At first, she was unresponsive. But when she woke up, she was dead. Then she was identified as alden. The man next to her had a dark expression, a white beard, and a thin, dark hair. He pulled out a gun and began shooting at her. The man who had fired his gun was not wearing the bullet-proof vest or gloves that alden had shown him. He grabbed her, pulled her up onto a bed and dragged her to the hospital. As it turned out, all this happened without any warning and without any warning. "I remember the first time I heard the shots. I was in the shower and I heard the sound of shots. I was just scared. I didn't know what to do. I don't remember who had shot me. I do remember thinking about who was in the apartment." Then alden went into an ambulance. The fbi conducted its first sting operation. The man with the gun was identified as gary r. Griesbach, jr.; he had a short, curly-haired man with a beard and curly hair, about 6 feet 9 inches tall, who had been walking a dark trail toward the apartment complex in the middle of the night. The target was sitting on top of his neighbor's porch, his shirt covered by blood. The victim had a black, dark, dark, and blue-green beard. ...

It is great.I feel like I am going to die, but my friends and I are going to be ok.So, I'm going to tell you: this is my story.It's the story of how my parents met.My parents met me when I was 7 years old.My parents met me when I was 11.They would take me to meetings called "Spider-man: homecoming."They would be in the room trying to figure out what I was doing.And I would tell them the comic book story of how my parents met.A lot of what they were saying to me, some of them came from my dad.I think about it, when he told their stories, they all had stories.It was like the most interesting thing for me, because that was the weirdest thing for me, and they just didn't know what to do.And I would tell them the stories, and they would say, "Oh my god!" And then I would say and I'd do it again and again.I would tel...
922|It was a pretty bad day. The first day was really bad.I felt so bad. I couldn't sleep at all. There was all this stuff happening around my body. I wanted them to be okay. So, I had to give them more time. I was like, let's not go there.I thought that's a nice thing to do.I was like, I don't think it's such a bad thing. So, I said, okay. Let's just go home.I had to just keep my head up.Oh, yeah! Right. I wanted to go home.Then, one day, just like after my first day, I had these guys. The first one was a super young guy. He was just a little bit older than me. His name was scott. And he was really into his game. I think it was because he was the only one with the game to beat, I think. He kept up the pressure. He was like, 'hey, I think we're going to win, and we should beat you like 6-3.'So, I didn't know what to do. I didn't really want to listen to that stuff.I didn't want to try to do a thing that was going to hurt him. I didn't want to try to do things that he was going to do.If he played a lot of minute...
923|I was a kid on christmas eve when my mother was working. We had just arrived in seattle from hong kong and I was just starting high school so when she came in I found out a guy with a nice big beard, like a jaywalker, was about to take him to a bar. It was his friend. But my mother came up to me like, "Who's this guy, you're going to have to go to the bar with this and go eat there with me?" I'm like, 'well I can't go to this bar unless I pay a guy for a drink and then go for drinks with this guy, too.' She told me that he was a really beautiful guy. We came down to seattle and we bought $500 and a couple of beers. I was like, wow, I never would have guessed that guy would have something like that. At the bar, I went to our bartender to ask if someone could buy something. They just laughed and it was like, "You're amazing man." He was great.Q. You have also been in a few celebrity relationships. You started a career in the late 1990s, got your start in the 1980s. What did that experience bring you to do what you do?A.

924|i remember being in the back office when the news was beginning to emerge that some of my coworkers had been murdered in the previous few months by an undercover fbi agent who was supposedly working for trump tower's former press secretary. I remember telling them, "You look like a dead man. You look like you've never been shot at. You look like you can do anything right." And so they shot me. And one of my coworkers, who'd been in the news department at the time, was murdered with a knife by a member of trump's family. I had my picture taken. When I got to work, he was dead. People came to ask him what he was doing; he had his picture taken. He said "I was in the press room."I can remember when I was in the press room getting up to work with a reporter. He was a black guy, about 5-foot-4. He had a beard and black hair. I was in the press room and he said, "Why are you doing this?" He went to say, "Do you have anything to say?" I said, "No."It went on for four hours. Then he said, "You're not talking to me about the fact that this is going to be investigated." And I said, "I'm saying…you don't even know what a conspiracy is, how are you going to get here?" And he came back to me. And ...
925|In my first week at university, I was a junior at an english-speaking university in london, and I was sitting in a small meeting room discussing the future of london. A group of young english-speaking students were sitting in the back and they were chatting about economics and the future of the country. And one of them came up to me, who had a big smile on her face.I was sitting down with a group of five or six guys. They were all pretty much from the back. In the back was an english-speaking guy: a little kid who didn't think much about economics. I saw this kid, and started walking towards him. I felt pretty strongly about my decision. For sure, I liked economics, I never had a problem with that stuff. But at the time I knew that if I went to work as an academic, or as an economist, I'd have to study something different. I thought, "Oh, right, I'm so sure I'm going to make it, that's so stupid."Then one of them came up to me and said, "You're young. Why did you come to us?" I said, "I wanted to learn about business. I didn't want any financial background at all." I had a degree in engineering from cambridge, and I had no interest in economics, so I made it my dream to become an economist.I told them, "How did you know about economics?...
926|In 1991 the world's biggest music festival was held in los angeles, california. It came to an end with the loss of the biggest musical event of the decade, the grammy awards.A lot of things in hollywood and in america are not working out. We are trying to do better than that. We need to start thinking of new ways to do that. Because that's so exciting, and it's very hard to start thinking about things that are not working out. It's been a long time, and we are going to get through that.How much does it take to get to this point?My first major breakthrough was in the 1990s when we finally worked with james mazzucchelli and bob moulde about a collaboration with the late michael corleone called "The last year." It was great to work with him and our producer, michael, and to work with both, john and mike, and to have them say something like, "Look this whole time there were so many great artists here." And that is what happened.I think it was about the same time that the rolling stones turned it into a hit, which is now one million copies sold and we have to sell it. And after that it was about, "Well, why the hell would I want to let you come to this show on a saturday night when there were so many great artists?"The way we've talked about our relationship with michael an...
927|The first time I saw the film was from my childhood — I remember having a lot of fun trying to write a story for someone who was really funny, but not like that."Then, he remembered about the story. Then one day he saw it in the newspaper and said, "It's real."The filmmakers took a long look at the film, but they told him they would eventually show the movie to the public and "Go through it again and make sure it's there for years to come."Then I would sit in my office and watch it and see if it was worth it," Anderson says. "I was just so nervous about what the film would be. I didn't know if it would be interesting or not. As time went by, it grew."And he knew at least 10 other people who wanted to see the film, so they sent the movie to them. Now he's seen 15 other people watch it — not just james franco, but also other actors like james gandolfini and woody harrelson."What I loved about it was the emotional impact," Anderson says. "It was very funny, and there were so many laughs for sure. I think it was a bit a bit of a shocker to see the film being released, but as the year went on it grew."At first, the film was a bit of a mixed bag.The production team never had the patienc...
928|One of the kids was taking me to the playground. He said, "Mom, I'm going to have a game, and I can't see the game." I said, "What about the other kids?" And the kid said, "Oh, I have to go to the park with them."And the kid said, "Why can't I see the game?" Well, he was going to go outside, and the kids were going to tell me how they came. And so I took him to the park where everybody was going to play. And he said, "You can't see it unless you're there." It was a great little game.So then I said, "I'll play." My first impression was great.And he said, "Mom, I need to play." I said, "Do you know what the heck the hell a game is?"So I said, "Mom, I won. Well, I play it. I won." He said, "You're right." So I went back to the park, and the kids were down in the middle of the park.And they got to sit around a little table and watch the game. And suddenly I went down there and I was on my knees, with my hand on your mom's shoulder. I said, "I'm in this to play with you." I said, "Are you going to play with another kid? That's too ba...
929|in my first day as a professional basketball player, I played for two teams, the kansas city wizards and brooklyn nets. I played with the team for three years. One of the guys in the locker room said, "You know what, look, you have to do this." I made it. My first year as a professional player, I didn't play any nba games.I was in the team for less than a month and I was playing with my girlfriend. There I thought, "Hey, we have to keep playing because we just don't have enough time for this. We need to have the talent to move up, and that means getting more shots off the dribble, and that means getting better against the ball. It's kind of an all around problem. That's why I can't play for a team. I can't play for a coach, because he's got a lot of experience, and he really needs to have all these different ideas. I don't want to have to look at it this way."That's what we did, and that's what I'm here for. This game, this organization, this team is all I need right now. The people I was playing with made sure everybody knew what was going on and what was going to happen. We didn't have enough time to see it. We knew we had to go.And if you look at the game tape, you can see that the last ...
930|We were driving on a dirt road up a hill when a motorcycle suddenly hit us.The rider was hit with the motorcycle and the rider did not have what would have been considered fatal injuries or serious damage to his body.The doctor told the man to let go of the bike. He had taken off his helmet and the doctor said that that is when he was supposed to be stopped. The doctor said that what had happened was not right and he was told that the rider must have suffered serious injuries to his head, back and arms. The doctor went on and told the man that you couldn't go on to the street. He had to get out of your car to get out of the truck. He pulled out a knife and stabbed in the side of his head. He had to crawl back out of the truck and get out of there.The doctor asked for him to put his hand up to his head, but said no.The man said that he was going to a church or a church and the doctor put on his headband. He said that the helmet was already attached and he was going to be out there with the knife and knife. The doctor then went into the car and stopped him.The doctor said that he had to put a piece of cardboard on top of the knife just to get it out and he was going to be put into the van.The man said that, at first, he thought that he woul...
931|in april 1997, I was about twenty-four years old. I was writing for an international magazine, and I was visiting the country I was writing for. I walked through a field with a friend. Our country was in shock, and there were no journalists here. When we met, the man with the big black hat said: "I saw that you were trying to sell me a picture of the world championship. I hope you're gonna sell me an image of your own." He told me that he had a picture of what I was really looking for, and that, somehow, he and I had to go out to talk. In the meantime, I was getting really creative, trying to find ways of expressing the kind of ideas that I was trying to express.That same year, in july of that same year, I was having a birthday party with my cousin, who was born seven months ago. She was really into photography. I was going to a party in a big high school at that time, and I got a call from her parents, saying: "Mr. Puckett, you know that I bought this photo for you, and I'm going to send it to you, and if you don't do it, I'm going to take it home to you when I'm ready to be out here on the field." And I got a call from an agent in germany at that time, and I was thinking, "What if this isn'...

I stopped, and the car that got me here was going over the right lane on the left side of our road. And the driver of the car that got me here, I was driving the wrong way and had to turn left, and a different car was just running into the wrong lane and hitting us. And so then I just said, 'can you hear me? Ok, this is what I'm hearing.'...
933|I live in a big town in colorado called boulder. We're in the middle of a recession and the recession has started and after a nice financial crash, my daughter came from ohio to go to school there as an engineering student. My husband and I have two kids at home. In 2005, I found a job in a technology company there and started the company I still have. The job I held for 30 years after that, was to buy a house. The house was not worth the investment. It was a flatbed truck tractor, an unlicensed car dealership, a home that was on a farm. At that time, I had no money so I bought the tractor. That's what we were going to do, and that's what I left. My wife and I bought the home in 2011. Well, that's what I wanted to do with my life.So i've done this for 30 years now without any problems. I think it's really nice to live in colorado and it's very easy to do. And it works out pretty good. I love my job here. I love my family.

934|Every evening in june, in the same room, I heard one of the girls, in a dress, talking to a girl in the bathroom, that was not the girl I remembered. She got up and looked at me. She said, "I know you," And said, "I know you," But I did not say anything to her. What was I saying? I was thinking about a girl in a dress.My friend turned to a woman who was sitting next to me, looking at me intently. She said to me, "Tell me one thing you think I should tell my friend about this night. Tell her about something that is just so awful she has a bad case of hysteria or whatever." I said, "Oh, no, no," Saying I thought that this woman was in fact my friend. I felt guilty, but I got over it. I didn't tell anyone about this night. I was only thinking about it because the girl in the dress was so sad.You think about the fact that this one woman was so sad? She thought, "No, I don't want to hear about anything of this sort." I thought about it as a matter of course, but we all know how terrible the situation is. All of us are affected by this type of behavior. We all know very well, for certain, that if you are in a hotel room, a party girl can wake up one night and not feel like a human bein...

And I have a daughter! And I have a man's mother who is a girl. And I have a man's father. And he's a man of a woman. And in the end, the man of that woman in the middle of being with a boy, is a man of the young woman. And I mean, so when I look at my body these women in the middle of being with a man, and that's the story, it's really, really, really ugly-as-hell. I mean, it was awful. But it was real. And those beautiful women have really done the best for us over the years, and I think they gave us the strength we needed to make a difference.Now it's time for me to take your hand and take it off. You know, I don't think I can put that up like I'd like to. And just the other day I asked my husband, "Are you ok and what are you going to do?" He said, "I don't know. I know you're on that drug. I think you need help. Please, please, please, come do whatever it is right now with u...
936|A girl named chloe came by in the middle of the night when she was walking home from school.She was wearing a top that had a nice little skirt, but she was wearing a dress.She said, "I love you chloe!"Chloe said, "Yes? Yes, I love you.I love you too chloe."And then as chloe got up from the bed, they were on the floor, staring at each other.There was a brief moment after, and chloe looked up at her. "You're not here for me? Don't you hear?""No!" The girl said."I'm okay," Chloe replied.She ran her fingers through her hair, reaching for the back of the dress to keep it down. "Oh yeah?"She looked up at chloe. She reached down once, and pulled that back. "Don't you want to be alone? I mean, you do. Not even in school, aren't you?""Yes, yes chloe," Chloe said."I'm not going to pretend to not be here because of you, I'm not. I can't be here for you either," Chloe said.Chloe got up and put her hands on the back of her neck, putting the back of her dress back in place. "But I don't want to go away at all. I want someon...
937|It was in the summer of 1982. I was there at the meeting of a group of women who had had their first meeting in the morning and thought, "Oh, we'll go in later. It's only going to be about two guys." One, who happened to be a woman, said he was tired of all the guys in the room, not because he wanted to come over and see some new people, but because there were a few guys that were not there. So he came up and met them. And that brought it all to a head. It was quite a moment. It was an emotional moment. And the next meeting was in september of 1984, at the party house. And one thing was clear: there were only two women there. And there was a sense of, "I don't want them ever." They never went into hiding. And they were never arrested for any of the crimes committed by those two women. A lot of the women said that, "No they never would. And they came in very early. They were not even in high school. They had never ever even met each other." And when the first women arrived, they were, "Oh, this woman is beautiful, she looks kind of young." Now I don't think I would have known any of it. I would have never met that girl.Q: so the "Real" Issue with your book, that you are one of the first to bring to light in th...

We are the largest jewish community in the whole kingdom. Let's meet with them at your meeting there." So we called them up to the meeting, the president of the rabbinical council for deaf. They said, "We want you to meet with them." We told them, we have two or three of them. They said, "We want you to meet with us, but you have to agree to meet with us, and when we meet we will meet one another." We said, "We have two or three of them." And it turned out they were both in the jewish agency for the deaf.Amy goodman: rabbi yoav cohen.

939|You were on the roof of the building one night, and when you saw somebody else, you just froze and jumped when you saw them. The person in the back, a woman, was standing by the window. She was dressed in a long skirt that just caught on fire and melted you. I saw this girl, with her face covered, and then suddenly it was so hot, when I looked in the window and saw this person, who was with a huge group of kids, she was in the middle of the fire.A little later I came over to her and said, "Are you sure he wasn't in the back of the bus?" She said, and she said oh, he was. She was very emotional, very upset. I told her, "You're going to have me go to the doctor. You have to have me do this." And she said, "No." And I said, "Well, I will."When I saw the video, it was just so shocking. I thought what we had seen of this girl, this woman with a huge group of kids, this woman was in the middle of the fire. I thought, "What are you doing?" So I just went into my car and drove home, and I could tell that she was really emotional. I called them and told them what I had found out.In that video, you can see the firefighter's face and he was screaming, "You're takin...
940|It's one of our things that when you're not on the job and you're just doing what I say on your watch, you need to be able to do a lot of things. You need to be able to get on with them. At this point, I still don't know if you're even thinking of trying to set up that in the first place.And it's not something that I just wish everybody had done. I think it would have been better if somebody had been on the payroll in this capacity for a long time. I think that would have made a lot more sense. And I don't know what will be the best way to try to take that and make it work.Q: and it's interesting that you say that you're not "Ready" To leave. When you say you're "Ready," That you're not "Working" To do everything that you did?A: I am still working for the company. I'm not even ready to put a job down. I'm not ready yet to retire. I'm not ready for anything that will bring into being the next larry summers.Q: what do you mean by "Complete" As opposed to "Not working?"A: I mean not that I'm doing everything.

That is why you have decided to join the resistance for better and you now stand ready to fight when we have to. My wife and children have done an incredible job and, I hope, they have done an amazing job as well. Thank you very much.When do you expect to see the end of your struggle?I don't want to give you the exact timeline of when. There are a lot of obstacles on the road. I am a young woman and there is a lot of pain. I know what the struggle is and I am a young man and I have some struggles, but this is the only way I can be a person that I am. A woman who has had the support of her family and friends, she can't have no support anymore.Can you say a little bit more about yourself?I am no longer a man that has been a man in a man's world. I am a single mother, married for 15 years. I am a single man. I am a single mom, and I am a single woman. And I am a single woman. My family is in the background because, I had been married and I had moved in with my sister. The first time I had a child I had a very very special moment. The second time the first child died, and I was so excited to hav...
942|It's very hard to read a book that is about a person who is trying to break you, and yet, this book is about a person who has been through an unspeakable experience of self hatred, who is so committed to ending his or her own life that he decides to do it. He doesn't choose it, but he tries to make it his own.You're in love…you're in love.Don't you just love it?He's in love with you.Are you the most handsome man in the world?He has been.You're being really beautiful all the way up to the point where you have more of an ability to communicate your feelings in front of people than you've ever had before.So…he's in love with you like a good, good boy.Can you say more about how you're so passionate about this book?I love it!Is this the beginning of the end?No, but it doesn't stop. It's just a much nicer experience.What's your biggest regret?I've had two children before. I'm so happy, and I don't want to stop. I don't want to take anything away from my partner…why is this different for you?I love you. I'm the best friend I'm ever going to ever have...
943|That's when I saw the first sign that my own self-belief was starting to break.I was walking into a crowded bar and saw a stranger, an elderly man sitting in a white suit. I asked him what he did for a living, and he asked to see my wallet and jewelry, and I asked to borrow him a bike back home, and all I could do was walk.He gave me a tour of his home, and I told him to put on his shoes and shoes, which looked a lot like mine, and he looked at me for a moment."Are you here for an ice cream?" He said, with a laugh. "You need to show me where to get a bike!"I looked at him in wonderment, which is when I remembered for the first time. All I had in my mind was that he was a friend, and he would come over here every once in a while.At first, I thought this was a joke. He'd only come in for a little walk, so to speak, and he'd arrive with some things he'd need. But when I looked around, there was just nothing I could do.He had left my wallet on the table. I had put it in my pocket, and there was his wallet, and there was the bicycle he'd borrowed to ride home.For the first time, I wanted to tell him. It was a...
944|My first experience with this product was when I got my first dose of the drug, dmt. I wanted it to be more of a euphoric experience, so I would get something different every time I smoked it. This was the first time I had ever smoked marijuana. I was very excited about it. I was almost on vacation, so I had an idea of what it smelled like that I liked better, and I got into it. I was getting into all the other strains and all I could think about was how to smoke marijuana without it being so awful. It was very nice. So after that I went back to the old house, and I smoked it again at some other place. I smoked it in the bathroom without using my mouth, and it was good. It was great. I had other experiences with this drug, too. But I really had no problem with it. I really did want it. It was nice to have. I had never smoked anything like this before."I have an interest in the effects you get when marijuana is inhaled. I am going away right now with a feeling I already feel in my body and it will continue to bring me enjoyment. I plan on getting the results with dmt. There was no rush. The experience was very enjoyable, but I had no regrets in my decision. The fact I was trying to try this all in one day is so rewarding. I am glad I didn't do anything wrong. I woul...
945|back in the days of the first millennium b.C., the yayyyy and the t'aiy of the yayoi, are actually the same thing. In the yayoi, the t'aiy is called the yayoi yayoi or yayaya yayaya or yayaya hoshikiri yayoi (god is god). The yayoi yayoi in the old testament is called yayoi yayoi yayoi, which means "The way of the lord." In the new testament, the yayoi yayoi is called yayoi hoshikiri yayoi (god is god). The yayoi yahya yayoi is the way when it is called "Hoshikiri yahya yayiya," Which means "The way of the way of the yayoi." Now, in the yayoi, the yahya yayoi is the yayoi yahya yayiya, (god is god). When it is called "Hoshikiri yahya yahya yayiya" (god is god), the yayoi yayoi is the yayoi yahya yayiya; and when it is called "Hoshikiri yahya yahya yayiya" (god is god), the yayoi yahya yayiya is the yahya yayiya.The god of the old testamen...
946|i found a little girl who was doing a school event and I was a little mad because I could see her eyes and said to her, 'my kid's school is being bombed. Go find a place and don't forget to make sure all your stuff can survive.' That was a very sad moment for her. So I went to her and I said, 'you should have stayed there, you should have left us there and we wouldn't have had any of this happening to you, to your family, to those around you.' She said, 'no, that is not what she said.'"In other words, she had been exposed to a situation that was so horrific it made her feel like she had lost all credibility, even though she had lived it. There was no way her body would have survived. Even if her mind had not, she would have died."People look at me like crazy, and I know that. It's not because I'm a crazy person. I am a man for a living, a man for a love. My daughter has a good heart, and she looks at me like a crazy person on a daily basis. She said, 'i'm scared because I have this fear. I am in a real mental breakdown, and I can't stand it.' But she is a woman. This is who she is, and she has lived it for her child. She has been in this way for so long, and sh...

We're going to continue our show in a minute, but first, let's talk about the war and peace debate: we all know the white house will not respond to a request for an interview. Why? Because the president and his administration are going to call the press before they've even briefed reporters. The most serious point of those calls is the president's promise, and it's something that the white house has been saying, the president is working very hard to deliver.So the president is going to tell us that during his address to congress this week, he has said, because of the war in iraq, that he wants to en...
949|The first time I saw the story was during a lunch break in a bar that had an atm machine and someone had to pay with their mobile phone.The first time I saw it, I couldn't believe how fast it was. It was really fast. And I was at the atm machine and they were charging me $500 more every time I got into their line."What am I going to do? What am I going to do?" He asked.That was what they had told me, but when I asked them, they told me they weren't going to stop, but they wouldn't stop. They said I had to wait, and that they were going to give me back my card and I was going to do that.They said I went to the atm to pay $5.50. I went to the cash register.I saw a young lady who had a lot of money. That made me wonder if she had been robbed or someone was trying to rob her.The store owner had to explain to me he had given her a card and that money that he had kept in his bank account to pay when he walked through the door to the cash machine wasn't really there, and that it was not going to show up for her with a debit card.It wasn't really clear what was going on.So I got a different approach — I turned it over to the detective and took him t...
950|My family has been here all these times. Our grandparents were coming home from school when I was 6 years old and my grandfather was coming home from kindergarten at 16. They had been here all these years. We remember sitting in a big-box store in an old school townhouse. This is my family. We had nothing. They were just standing there with their hands in their pockets. No one could even remember what the words were. They could never tell us what, what they did not know. They didn't understand that we had been here all these years and they were in this little house. We were sitting there in a big-box store and the windows were all rolled up and closed. We didn't even understand how we were there. They didn't care about us. He was just sitting there with his hands in his pockets and no one could even even recall what they just did not know. They knew something, so they were angry. But when they didn't know, they just walked straight into the house and they were upset because they knew we were in the house today, they didn't even know. I remember walking into an old-school grocery store and I had forgotten the words that I just heard when I saw them. They walked out of the store and they went to their car. Then you look at me today and you realize, you could have used your hands in this store, but you know you couldn't. You know. You could have seen those word...
951|"I said 'yes,'" The man said."He said it's a very good drug, and I had to pay for it," The man said."I said to him 'what are you buying for me?' He asked him," He said."And then he pointed out that I had a bag of marijuana inside of me," He said."Then the man said 'why are you selling it for my cash?'"I said,'why is the guy selling me a couple of pounds of marijuana for a couple of cents?' He said."He shrugged and said 'you're not selling it, you're not doing anything wrong.'""Because I told him that," The man continued."I said 'you're selling it for my car,'" The man said."Because I told him that," The man continued."'Why are you selling it to your children?'

952|I was in class and our teacher was asking us to write an article for the class. We were all writing and he was like 'we should write this for you'. There was something there but no writing. The teacher was telling us 'you need this to make sense and give us the information you need'. He said 'it's important, but maybe you're not looking for it'. 'And I asked him if he'd write about it for us. We said no, but he said it didn't matter, because you're not writing this for us, but that you're doing an article for me'. And I asked 'why?' And he said 'because it's so good to have you work for me'. He said 'because it's fun! I'm writing this for you.'"On a more serious note, he was very much interested in his mother – he's in her mind – and he was very proud of his mother for the role she plays in the narrative."I'm very proud of my mom for playing a part in it, but it was actually pretty hard for her to know about it so she knew about my mother's story," Says smith."I think people are very afraid of the portrayal of women and a lot of them don't know about a lot of things in life. I think we are all aware of things in life and it doesn't make us feel good to be a woman or feel like 'this isn'...
953|One of the reasons you became, you would say? Because you said, in the past, all the people who were oppressed were oppressed, and so, as a matter of fact, in the past—so they thought that our language is not something, at least—in all the world—i thought that to be so true. And, you know, I really said that to [sic] the american people in the past. And, if any of this is true, it is in the present that we must go.Amy goodman: and is that the case, and is that a statement of fact, or is this a lie about our history?Sanders: it's not.Amy goodman: is that—as you mentioned, the fact that you wrote the book, which is based on the work of the activist and feminist group—a group called the center for a new american security, right?Sanders: yes, that's right.Amy goodman: and it was really the name of a book called democracy now!, what happened to that?Sanders: yes, it was this, because I was actually working as a student at one of these protests, and the police beat me up. Because they did not know what I was writing, but they—and then they would go out and attack me, and they would do it again and again, and again and again. And so, one da...
954|The first time. I was about a hundred people, all around the world and all around the world, and I was standing on a hill, with two people, and they were all over the park, standing on the hill and they were shooting, and I was staring at the camera, and I was telling the guy that shot, 'he's shooting down a helicopter. You're going to land the helicopter down, too.'When I'd done that, at least 12 people jumped off the hill and I said, 'that was a joke. It was the joke.' This was one hundred and fifty-nine people, all around the world as well. That's about fifty-nine percent of the world. I was laughing and I said, 'that was a joke.'A lot of it just started in the united states. The thing that made america great was the way that we thought about the world, and we started to think about people, that was how people treated us, so we didn't think about them as bad things or bad people, but as something that people had to deal with, so we didn't talk about that. And that was the world that we thought about.So we started to think about how people felt, and how they might feel around us, as if we were something to us, a blessing or a curse, and we thought about how people would talk to us. People wanted to know if the helicopter ha...
955|i was born in 1957 at the age of 17 and have always loved the music of the band, which was so much fun and fun to me. I had never heard of any metal record at that age so I thought it would be useful to talk about that band in person. I was playing rock and roll for one-half years of my life before I turned 18 so they were pretty cool.They had a lot of great bands, from the '60s and to this day people are still saying the names of the bands, but I never felt we had a lot of power and I never felt I was a big fan of any of the bands in the band. I didn't know anything about it so I thought it was a good time to write about them.A few years later (a couple years before they turned 20) I heard about their other record 'no tears', and I was more than excited to see what they had in store when they turned 20.I had never heard of any metal record before I met them so I thought it would be a good time to tell the stories in a way that kept the reader honest with the band.I'm not sure I want to go over the events of 'no tears' though, since that would have been kind of like playing on the playground for me. But I will say that I loved playing with these bands back then, especially metallica.I'll never forge...
956|I'm working for a newspaper. I'm the man who was supposed to represent the people, so I'm a political journalist. My career has been so long since i've been a reporter. In fact, my whole job has been to tell you that.The story of why hillary clinton got off so much better than donald trump:1. She didn't have 'em, and she was a very competent manager. She would have done a lot better for this job if she had been paid $11.6 million a year. And I think she did a better job for this job. She hired people who were going to change this. This isn't a job that's for free. She didn't want to leave this job or anything like that.2. She didn't have any other choice than to run for president, or to become a republican presidential candidate. I mean, I don't think anyone is going to say that she knew how to run for president.3. Her career was in a kind of a '60s-inspired sort of thing, as if there was nothing to it except that she was the perfect politician.4. I think that would have been a much bigger mistake to leave the job, to not be successful, to try to make a career change and not move to the united states. But she did that.5. At the end of the day, I really believe that she's ha...

A picture with the words, "Rape bulls" Painted on it, in the middle is the same picture with the words, "Rape bulls."You don't tell me this because you don't know what you're going through.

959|One of the great discoveries of the last few decades in american politics was the discovery that so much information is available to everyone about the workings of the big corporations. This has given us a new kind of information, a new kind of understanding of who really is on their side and who are going to win elections against them. And we know that we are in a moment where it is actually time for those political forces to put their political hands in front of the media.So let us do that by talking a little bit more about what are the big issues of our time right now. First of all, how big is the government? How big are we talking about the health of our nation, and how do we build the infrastructure to actually deal with the future, that is this big government we can just walk under. There are four pillars that are built in the united states government: the executive branch, the legislative branch, the judiciary, and the military. These two branches, the executive and the legislative, are different. Each branch is built around a certain goal: to accomplish what the executive is seeking to accomplish. This is a very specific, very specific goal, and we should recognize that. And that is what's going on right now, because, first of all, that it is very, very costly for congress to legislate, and for the president to legislate and to govern, and to go into the senate and to go into the house to work with the president. An...
960|A woman, the young woman from grief, is in her 50s. Her husband is a man, the young man from pervs in ireland, and she is sick of being dragged out of her home in her 30s. The family is in the care of the doctor, and he is a very handsome man. He lives in a flat, he has a small car, he lives in the house and, while being out at the lake is in the morning, he comes home and he sees me working the car. He asks the police if they want us to talk to them but we refuse. We go on talking with the police, but they tell us to hide. The little man gets a new phone and goes back to his house. He has no money to do the job. The police come to his house and the old doctor, who was with him a long time, has to go. He says that he thinks I must have been a thief. I say, "I see, there's no way I could have done that." The doctor says that if that's true, then he's a thief. I have nothing but sympathy for this family, but it really was my fault. My wife tried to give it a try, but she was scared. The doctor went to the hospital. He came up to me, was quite cheerful, and told me that he was a doctor. He was very sad about it. I said to him, "What could ...

962|You're sitting there in the hallway at a party—he was just so funny, just weird. You had just gone to work. The guy's a good friend of yours. So he took me out to dinner, and he said, "We've got to go get our drinks." I said, "Yeah, we've got to go." And he said, "Sure." I said, "How's it going?" I said, "He's great—so funny, so funny." And he was like, "What? I'm just laughing." And I went through my entire day. I was very nervous. I went out for dinner, and I said, "I want to thank you so much for bringing me here, because you're my friend." And he just looked at me like, "Why don't you tell your mother? Tell your dad." And I asked him why he didn't tell, and he said, "Because he's just, he can't tell me anything." And I just kept crying, because of all the stuff I was going through.You're from new york, where it's called the "City of comedy," And I was at that party on a bus, and then you got over the crowd—and I was sitting there like, "I can't believe he's saying nothing." I knew he was very funny, but it's really hard for me to know how to explain this and be able to d...
963|You know, in the 1970s, we were the only nation in the world that had an income tax, it wasn't going to be popular, it would be an issue there. So, we decided to make this issue of income tax something that, we think, could be done at the state level, at the federal level, but the federal level would have to be a revenue-neutral way of doing that.Amy goodman: so, how did you come up with this idea, starting with a state that was so heavily involved in the fight with oil drilling?Jeremy hugluas: well, first of all, in our own state, we had to get rid of this tax. We had to get rid of a few things, but first of all, no oil companies that were drilling there—that were making money. So, there would be an incentive to use that tax revenue to invest in the development of new oilfields in the state of colorado. It wouldn't have to be the fracking of fracking. We could get it in there, and we could continue to run the oil companies, the chemical companies and the pharmaceutical companies all over colorado, and we could continue to run the state, and colorado would grow. The state would be like a gigantic economy.And, you know, this has been, you know, the case all along. And we realized when the first wells were drilled, that if you had a good investmen...

965|In the middle of january of 1985, I was looking down on the street in my own neighborhood. I was like, 'oh my god! What's going on?'" He says. He didn't know what to do. "I didn't know what to think," He adds later. "The first thing I thought, 'oh, he's in a movie!' They said, 'it's not good. It's not good.' "The hollywood reporter's james cameron, who had the job of directing the hunger games, was just as quick to point out the situation. "It was an open secret in hollywood that the movie was not a hunger games, to me at least," He says. "It's the first time I have ever heard of it."There was an obvious way out of this. "The first way out," Cameron says. "But I was scared to death, because the movie was about to come out. I thought, what was going to happen? There would be a movie, or there would be no movie."For decades, that movie had been in a hotel room in the back, along with a few posters for the movie. For more than a decade, cameron's hollywood work has been in the hands of his brothers and sisters: the actors, the editors, the actors. But it was his brothers' love of the movie that ultimately set the line on his most controversial, and most controversial, movie....
966|It's been a lot of work because the money we've raised for the city of vancouver has been used by local organizations to bring a number of new affordable housing projects to the downtown eastside. But the fact remains that there's a need for affordable housing."It's something that is incredibly hard to get started, and really hard to get organized to be able to get out and buy a house in vancouver, but I believe it's something we need to do," Says dr. Richard. "It's something we're working on right now in vancouver."Dr. Richard has spent his life supporting local organizations who have the chance to be a catalyst in the process of making housing affordable for vancouverites. He's heard it firsthand from people who are looking for affordable housing in their neighbourhoods."The first wave of people in vancouver were on bikes. We're seeing an upsurge and a rapid growth in that demographic because of this community-led movement to bring housing to the downtown eastside," Dr. Richard says. "So there was a lot of work and a lot of collaboration that was on the ground before we ever saw it."What's really amazing is that dr. Richard and the rest of the vancouver development board (vbed) are working in tandem on some very important things, including the creation of affordable housing by vancouver first nation. For example, at the vancouver development board's annual meeting on aug. 17, they're introducing the firs...
967|A teenager came up to me with a question – "How do you understand what you see?" He was so surprised. He thought that my brain was just a giant hologram, and what the hell is going on there? All of us do it. So I thought that we could just learn what's actually going in, and what will happen."But the problem is that his brain doesn't take into account that there's no one in his head. The answer is: there's no one in the world. So, I don't think he understood me, because if an entire planet was in there, that's a tiny bit of a problem. I mean, you can come up here and you can see the entire world – the entire planet, and you have this strange, beautiful, beautiful universe: I guess that's the point. But then you have a huge amount of information about the entire universe – that's one of the difficulties.The whole idea is, that if you can look at all of the information, all of the information, then to have this big set of different relationships with your brain comes to a lot of problems. We're seeing things in different ways. We're seeing some things in different ways; and sometimes there are things that don't really matter.One thing that you think about at work is that all the information that you have is somehow still there. But, really, if you can tell you this stuff in your head...
968|The guy at my job just said that he was going out to sell me a ferrari. When he got back from his meeting with paul, he said, 'i'm the manager at the ferrari and I'm going to have to take you there. I've never had a ferrari so I'm going to drive you there.' The guy went and had a look at the window and he said, 'no, thank you but you need to go.' I said, 'okay, sorry. Let's wait for the manager and have this conversation'.""When I got in the car with paul, he said, 'you know what? The guy that was talking about that was the driver who took you on the car, what the hell he said. Then he made an impromptu apology to paul.' I was like, 'no, I'm not going out there taking him off the bike. I'm never going to do that. They will come and take you out. When I get back, I'm going to take you home.'"He also said that he was so impressed with those things he did in his time with the red bull team that he had the audacity to suggest to paul that he should try to be the biggest man in the world, so they could both work together. "No," Paul replied. "That's not my goal. It's mine and I'm going to go to other places."And, as one might imagine, there'...
969|a few years back, I was writing a book called I have a dream. I had written it about a young man who got himself arrested once for driving a car with a tire that cracked and then ran the brake pedal right out of the engine. He said he had been driving the car for a year, but then he stopped and then told another man he wasn't his driving partner, then took the tires off and ran. He got caught.That was it. You were able to be a good human being, because we lived in a time when the first day of your life was an open wound, you had to be able to be a good man, because you could have died. My wife told me the same thing, when I was a young girl. My brother told me the same.But i've never seen another person come up to me from a place where there was no such open wound. I've never seen anybody come up to me with a story like that. Not one of you.And now my brother, I think he's an honorable person and a good man. I have a lot of respect for him.So that's how I'm going to try to tell this story. I'm going to try to give it away—not because somebody else will tell it, but because there are so many people who could tell you exactly how that story turned out.And if you're a good man who care...
970|And here's one: a middle class african-american woman living in a small town called waco, texas, went to a hospital when she was a baby. She was so ill that when she went into hospital, she knew that there was no medical treatment. She could not make her baby. And she got to be a nurse in her own house, where she cared for her own sick children.But she got to be a doctor, which, obviously, she did. She got to be at the center of american life, and there was no doctor, so she said, "Don't worry, this is good. I'll help you get better." And she had to go without, she said, because she was sick with kidney disease.And then one of her friends gave her a kidney. And she came to the hospital, that's where she had been taken to the hospital the previous day. And it was a huge shock. And I had a whole room full of people who were like, "Oh my god. I can't believe this!" And then she went to the emergency room and she knew how to treat people. When she came to the emergency room, she told me, "I'm trying to save two lives. I know you have such good family and I can't do anything to help you."And I was just trying to help her, because she didn't know what she was doing. She'd never had any kidney problem...
971|This was at a festival called krasnobruch, in the city of rostov. It was the first time that no other place in russia met so many people, and every one who made time for the festival came to the capital at least once a year. It was the biggest festival in russia at that time.In fact, it is just as important for the next two years to be the best. I know there are going to be great things, but there are certain things that will happen, and I will make sure that we never forget.At the end of the night, at midnight we had a festival of different kinds, and I had to go. I thought that for a day, we would have a chance to talk to our guests, because there was a huge amount of people here. We had no problems with people, because we had no problems with other people. But then I started to cry some days. The tears were not very good. The people who were very happy were the ones who had not been so happy, and they did not be happy with me, but their tears were very bad.The first day before the festival there were three other festivals, but not many came to me because they knew people in other cities would not come, and that's when I started to see that people were not in love with the city. So I started to speak to them more often and it was the same for everyone in the cit...
972|I was in my middle and I came across a woman. She was wearing a brown skirt. She was a friend, some friends with me, and she was very young. She had a big nose and red hair. She looked kind of awkward."A friend took note that the girl had been in her room a couple of hours earlier, looking tired and lonely, and was saying that she hadn't gotten to meet her. The friend was so surprised and concerned that she took to calling him, so she called him back, saying he would be coming over soon, but that he said that she needed a room that would be for him and she could just move in there.Eventually the friend called in her friend's number. The girl called for the doctor, who said that the doctor had been in the room the whole time. The doctor came over and said "Please let me know if anything has happened. It's an ambulance." So the girl called the ambulance, and the doctor came over and the girl said "No problem. I'll be at home the next day. It's been a long time since we've seen each other. I'm sorry for the trouble, I just need a place to go. We'll meet up soon, okay?"So the girl came over and told the doctor that she had been waiting to see the ambulance for more than 90 minutes. She then went to the hospital at that time and said she would be back in a fe...
973|I've been doing this for a long time. I was 15 months old when my mom and I were fighting in syria. I was in school, but when I went to school, my parents, the teachers, just came from all over the world saying, "Oh, you know this is the war, we want to give you peace." And I told them I was just going to die because when I go to my kindergarten, I get to go back and look after my dad and my brothers. As soon as they realized my story, they said, "Yeah, we want to give you peace." They were not that far away from my mother and my father-in-law.At the kindergarten, I go back to my room with my dad, and there's a big box full of food. And my dad is like, "I saw you eating lunch, you were sick, you're not playing." So I go to school. My mom is with my dad, and the teacher was like, "Well, you're in the middle of lunch and you can't do anything. You can't do anything." So as soon as a teacher comes outside the class, and she gets a text, and she's like, "Hello, you'll miss this class. I'm on your lunch break." So she sends me a text and says, "No, I don't want you here. You're going to miss lunch. Come in." And I did...
974|I've been to every town and town and town and town. In the last 5 years i've gone from new york to new jersey, from new jersey, and i've got a feeling my life's going to be different in 5 years. So I said to myself, 'what do I do with this time? What do I do now?' And here I am, 10 years ahead of me.In fact, what's interesting is that I'm still working on the story because in the end I think it was more important than any of the other reasons we've been talking about for the last two years. I think it was much more important than anyone might imagine.Amy goodman: and, you know, for 20 years it was that idea that i've been working on? A lot of people thought I was kind of going to die at my party. But you know, I think that is my biggest secret.Mary clairs: it really has been a great secret. You know, I am just so dedicated to this story. I'm just so committed to having this story be told and to tell the truth, that is what I have been doing this entire 10 years now. I put people into places they would never dream of. I have a lot of personal stories to tell about my life. And I don't do it because I know I will never give up and I know that I will never give up. I want to tell thi...
975|It's what happened to me in the first couple of weeks that i've got this phone number. I've talked to a couple of people.So you get a text message, and I see that I'm missing some photos of you?[laughs.] uh, they're all in my phone. I'd guess you got to call them. When I get home, you're not going to know what time I'm missing unless you call ahead to see if I'm going to come up. I've got a pretty good sense of what my status is, and even though I'm missing my car, I'm going to do what I can to get back to work.This isn't a big deal, but I'm still missing lots of cars and people.That's ok.Thanks very much.[laughs.]how many cars are missing in a 30-year span? What does that mean for you?[laughs.]i don't know. It's really hard to find the perfect car or what I can find or what the exact cause is.Maybe you're thinking of the next two days that you're going to get back to work, then maybe you'll get better luck.[laughs.]the next day, we'll see if you have a chance to pick up the phone.But the next morning, I'm just not working. I can'...
976|A friend of mine told me that, at the age of thirty-nine, a black man had walked down the street when he was ten, walking home alone, and he said, "My god, my god, don't you see that this man walks home alone and walks after these negroes?" I said, "Yes, I see this man, and he goes with me, and I see him; I know he is white, so why should he say that because he is black?"For the rest of the rest of the evening as I watched, I thought, why should he do this? The black man could not understand that his brother was an old man and a young man; he didn't believe in the white person. But he said, "It is true, my god, my god, that he has done it, and he is white. I don't understand that it's wrong." He said, "Well, then he's an old man, so why should I believe in that? You see, I didn't think that my brother was white because I thought him black. I thought that my brother was white because he doesn't want to believe; in fact, it's not so much that I'm white, I'm just a white man; I don't know what I'm thinking. But I didn't feel that he was poor or white because of it. It was just that I thought he was rich.And what had ...
977|There is an important person on the staff at the department of homeland security who has come to our office. He is a wonderful and knowledgeable employee. He is one of those people who is committed to protecting america.It has been an honor working for him for the last 16 years, but he is here because of the work of the department of homeland security. He has worked at the department of homeland security for the last four years that was not the case, because he has worked at the department of homeland security for the last four years. There is very little that is going on on the other side that is going on. He is dedicated, committed and diligent as a person.And then one of the things that is happening on the other side is that the department of homeland security needs to spend a lot more money on their new, new training program, on the new programs. So one of the things that the department of homeland security is doing is they need to spend that. And so the president has made that point before, and he has not said, look we need to make sure that he makes changes or there are other changes in his program, because he will be making changes. And I have done that.You know, I believe at the same time, that we need to make sure that he makes changes.He has made a number of changes in his budget, and I believe he has made the changes. And we need to make sure that h...
978|In a family that does everything that they can to keep their children together, I had this idea to take out a job on the navy's training boat. I was going to go back to my home and meet some of these people. So I just flew back to england and had my family to watch over my son. Then I thought of my first son and decided to do it. For three months I worked here at the navy school to train the kids. I even asked my wife if she wanted to do it for me. And now it's just on tv. I watch all of that.So, I decided to go back home for two and a half years. So now I'm teaching our kids here. So what is it about your job that you work for? That's a job for a person who works in a military service. I am not from the united states of america. Why is it the case that you have a job as the first person to teach our boys and girls how to run a business? Why is it that you keep your kids together? I'm going to tell you why the answer is yes.When you say no, you get a little bit of a shrug. But I say yes because i've tried my best to make myself an effective teacher. I've learned that when I think something is not working, I look at things that should be working and think about my role. You don't want to go through the process of thinkin...
979|the first thing I realized was that some of what is happening was just not right. If you're a black woman, and you're an immigrant and you're working for an immigrant company to produce the sort of clothing we would expect, then you're going to have a hard time getting it right because there'll be problems with the production schedule, and that's exactly what I'm telling you, because you can't just give up the opportunity.If you work in a factory where your labor isn't really fair, you're going to be punished. And then you're going to struggle against this situation, and I have no idea how you manage it. I'm sorry about this. In the future, if I were to speak to an immigrant company that wants to produce clothes and it says to stop producing, it's going to have to stop. And this industry, they're not going to get through without the labor of other workers. So now, you've got to find something to work with. So even if you've tried, if you went to work on a field site or a garment factory, and the government didn't want you to be able to work on those things, there's no justification for you, and you can't.So if you worked in factories that were unfair to you or discriminated against you, then you're going to have to struggle. And to find something to work with, you'll still have to deal with the realities of lif...
980|My last book, the secret life of pablo picasso, was called, "The birth of pablo picasso." It was my best book. I had an idea, I had a vision, I had another idea. You know, I thought I was going to write a big book. I'm not sure if that was a big idea, but I did. It's just like, "I know what you're saying."Gross: right. And when I was a kid, I was a little kid in the early to mid-90s. I was very, very, very good at math. But I went to that same high school and I went to school in brooklyn, and I went to the same high school. I took a course called introduction to mathematics at yale in my mid-60s. I was very good at math, but I was not very gifted. I couldn't find any writing that was very much like mine and at all. I was a good little english degree student. So it was a good place for me to be from. I remember there was a lot of white-hat stuff going on in my high school. The teachers were racist. I mean, who did I think would get to sit next to my teacher like, "How can you be like this when you are african american?"And then, of course, when I went to college, I learned to be a better student. You know, I was at th...
981|We went back to the old building; we all wanted to go there in a few weeks. I just don't understand what happens when it comes to a group of 20 guys having a very heated conversation. How can they come in here to talk to us and we are not the same people? A lot of people want to do their jobs here, and a lot of people are looking for the best people in this country. That's why I had a very strong fight with the police and a lot of good officers. But I wanted to go here to look at people's lives."It was a tense day on the job. The building was packed with security guards, and they were on patrol every day. A lot of the police had a hard time identifying the men in the crowd – some were black and some were white, but the majority were male."We can take it a little bit further," Said officer gary, who is black."We could put them down on our way to the front gates. Why would they take us back to the back when we're so much like them? And we can take them back to the front of the building?""My question is this," Continued a man who was wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt. "Who are you? Do you have any kids? Why aren't we going to the front door?""Hey, we are going to the doors. What are you talking about?...
982|I'm a kid at a very young age, and i've just found that the most important thing in life is your ability to make sense of it. And once you've been through adolescence, and that's all, you know what you're going to do? Well, you've got to make sense of it. If it's the least important thing in life, then what have you done? If you're trying to understand it, what have you done? So i've thought about that. I've made a few changes. I've made some changes. I've even begun to get into the world of meditation. So i've started to start using it. I mean, when you have this profound feeling that you're looking up to this world every day, and this world is a completely different place, then it makes sense and it makes sense to you and it makes sense to yourself. So i've been working on this for a long time now. I feel like I'llgive it a shot when I am a student, and I'lllook forward to it. I'll take the time to get on and make more changes. It's really cool to see how you think. It makes you feel like an explorer. When I see some of the things you have to do daily, I think, well, I'm going to do it a little more each day. This is going to be my life. I'm going to do more things. I'm going to get up ou...
983|i started playing for a few years in junior high school, and played for a few years in college, and had to change coaches. Eventually, I dropped out and I had a family that I cared a lot about. I moved back home to kansas and I was very fortunate to be there. I thought there was an opportunity to play professionally for other teams – and to actually participate in that tournament. I had two very high school teammates, and we played a lot of basketball together.I'd only played a handful of games the first year of college, and the way I played the rest of my career, I felt that it would be the best chance to play for other teams. And as things have changed, i've become better. When I played for my alma mater in high school, those last three years I had a shot at becoming a pro. But I'm so proud of my freshman year, I think it worked out. I had a nice game against kansas that made me feel really good.I'm excited to get back into the game, to compete and win. And I love it. I love the university of kansas. It's a big part of my game, especially now that I'm in north dakota.I think as I get older, I look forward to playing a lot, just taking the minutes, working hard and not taking yourself too seriously. I feel like I get to play, and I feel like I can pla...
984|This was my last day working with the simpsons. I was at a comedy club. You know, there was this guy named george, who was a big kid. He looked like he was trying to kill someone. I was very curious because he was a kid when I was in california (laughs) and here I was at my home in washington dc. He took me into his apartment and started talking to me, and I was like, "What is this, you gotta talk to him?" Then, you know, when he said, you know, "I think I am gonna talk to you," I just said, "What's in his book?" He said, "What is in homer's book?" I said, "Who's homer?" And he was like, "Homer." And then you are like, "Really?"I got home and sat down on the couch and watched the simpsons. It was a great experience. Everything changed very quickly. I had a couple of kids, I had this huge couch. I was like —what's that?Yeah, I had a big couch that I had to use to sit down. I took things out, put down the television, and just had some drinks, and then I saw people sitting there. It looked like I was talking to people, and I was like, "Who is this guy?"Well, it sounds funny to say it because when the show starts, there will b...
985|My life is so horrible. I was born in the philippines. It doesn't matter how long I lived, I'm going to die there. And I didn't know that. I know the people of the philippines, but I didn't know the lives that they were going to put into their lives until this moment," She said."I'm the one living in the philippines with those people."That isn't the only negative thing she says about the filipinos who live here.Milo's life has been taken by so many of her neighbors, but she also says her country is one of those that keeps her in check."I don't want my country to be taken from me any more," She said. "I do not want to give any kind of punishment to anybody. That's the reason for being here."Milo says she doesn't feel welcome here even though she is from a country of color, which has a high rate of homicide and rape."If anyone's here and they kill my son my life will be over. That's my country," She said. "I have to make sure my son is safe. My life will be over soon."Milo is a former member of the philippines council of people's bishops and now an honorary member of the lgbt community at a national assembly of catholic bishops meeting in the philippines, where she said a majority of her followers don't accep...
986|And it's not my story. It's just a story of somebody with a big idea, maybe with a big vision, which is why we're going to have a lot of things happening. And they are things. But they are things that are not going to be happening. You don't look at it as anything different than a different sort of human experience. That's not our experience.Cristiano ronaldo is a man who is trying very hard. He says that.He says, "I'm doing it because I want the best for my country and, most important, I don't want to be the next lionel messi." What does lionel messi mean?Rése (cristiano ronaldo): well, you can change the world because you can change the story, because you can change the mind of the person that says, "Thank you." And that's what I did. It was a lot of work and lots of hard work. I learned a lot from it. I've done everything. It's something that I'm working on and I'm working on right now. And you know, you can't change the truth of the story when you can do that.I said at the time, I'm really trying. I've got my work in me. But I don't want to be part of a game of lionel messi. It's not my life.What has the future of lionel messi, or any othe...
987|They were in a little farm in oregon and got a little girl named amy. She was going to go to a school. They'd brought her here. And there she met a man called john, a mormon. John's name was joseph smith. He was the father of the prophet joseph and john's father was his brother sidney. And so they went to a little farming area in the back of the road. There john smith walked into them and he came to help them out. And so he came down to the house and he pulled out in the weeds, and his clothes were in the weeds. And he looked at and said, 'now we're going to have to clean this place.' And they cleaned up the weeds and cleaned up the land. And so he went back to joseph smith and he's the brother of john smith and there's about 200 of the children of the prophet joseph smith, and he helped a little girl named amy.Now, some of you might be wondering why he's named john smith.Well, when you say, 'i'll clean his house,' you're talking about a mormon. This isn't a mormon. He was a missionary, and he helped build the mormon temple all over the world. And he's the man behind the mormon temple. He was a lot of things. Some of which come from history. He was a young man. So his story is not a mormon. And to me, that's what he wa...
988|A guy called john, who would get into the car, and get pulled out of a friend's parking lot by a driver, because she's black. And he started to tell of the black family. And he wouldn't know what that means, because john said he'd have to go to a doctor, and he wouldn't know if he'd have to carry a gun. He wouldn't know if that was something that would kill him, or if he'd get hurt, and if he got hurt, he wouldn't have the ability to carry a gun." And he said, "What if everything came to hell?" And john turned around and said, "You got it. I'm not going to let you kill me. I'm not going to let you be hurt." So he said, "Well, maybe it will. Maybe it won't bring me back to the past. But I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you." And he told his story, and he had to tell it in front of his family. He wanted them to know that he was not doing that because he wanted his son to go back and prove people wrong. And he had to bring him to the police station.Amy goodman: the mother, who was there in that courtroom in october of this case, was killed by the defendant.

990|for eight years, dr. Srinivasan was visiting a medical school. When the faculty members came to campus to talk about the problems with the student loan program, he noticed an odd pattern.The students who had borrowed money for the college were taking a risk. They were starting to lose their money. Srinivasan noticed that the students who were getting the money were taking more risk. They were starting to lose their money. He looked at the situation and asked "Is this a big risk or not?"Students who had borrowed money for two years, with no other student loan options, then transferred to a different university to receive the money, found that they were losing money."You take a risk because that is what you want to do," Dr. Srinivasan said. "I'm not going to tell you what you've done. I'm not going to tell you how you should do it. You'll know, and you'll know that's what you need to do."Dr. Srinivasan said that the risk of losing an interest in a medical school depended on whether the student's parents supported the loan. As a result, his colleagues felt that if the student was going to become ill or lost a little money to pay for school, there would be a reasonable chance that his parents would take matters into their own hands."I'm glad you got this in for sure, but i'...
991|back in the days of the first millennium b.C., the yayyyy and the t'aiy of the yayoi, are actually the same thing. In the yayoi, the t'aiy is called the yayoi yayoi or yayaya yayaya or yayaya hoshikiri yayoi (god is god). The yayoi yayoi in the old testament is called yayoi yayoi yayoi, which means "The way of the lord." In the new testament, the yayoi yayoi is called yayoi hoshikiri yayoi (god is god). The yayoi yahya yayoi is the way when it is called "Hoshikiri yahya yayiya," Which means "The way of the way of the yayoi." Now, in the yayoi, the yahya yayoi is the yayoi yahya yayiya, (god is god).

992|i was in chicago the day before the chicago bears went down to the green bay packers. I was in the hotel at the time and I couldn't get to my room because I was in pain. At that time, I had been through some very tough times. That was the cold weather that had just hit and it was a tough time to deal with it.I told my friends, "You'll be fine. I'm going to go to the hospital. You're in good hands. I'll take care of you.""We just got out of there by that time."I was right there with him. He said, "You're gonna get a concussion. You're going to be fine. We're gonna be out of there by this time....
993|I was in a car with a guy who worked there. He was a real big guy. If I had to say hello he might ask how long had he been there. He was only 30, but he was an older man. So he asked me to stop and take photos or whatever. We shot him in his car, he's in a park, he's at the playground. You couldn't hear him, you couldn't see him. The other side of the road, we were talking and he said that we were going to take him to the hospital. He had a headache and I said that he needed to come home. The doctor said that we needed to drive, but I said that he couldn't go on without us. He said that he had the car stolen, so we were going to take him. I said that we needed someone to take care of him and I said they could do that. That was it for me. I thought of our job to be a doctor. I said that I knew what I had to do to get him to come home. Then the two doctors went to the hospital and they said that he wouldn't be taken. And I said, 'well, there he is, he's at the hospital.' And the first time he got out of the car, he had a headache. I said, 'are you ok?' He said, 'i am, sir,' and I asked him to come back. And he came back, an...

We're all dedicated to what we do. We are dedicated to what we bring to the program.

995|The first year I was a student. I was playing football. I was a sophomore and I was in my sophomore year. I was running back and I saw two of my friend's friends come, and one of them was the running back. I saw two of my friend's friends come, and one of them was the linebacker. I was just like, "What do you think? I just gotta do it." I wasn't thinking that kind of thing so that's when I started thinking that way. I was in high school and I was just studying for my degree.I remember first saying, "What do you think? I just gotta do it." And I knew I could do it but I just gotta keep progressing and continue to improve, and then there was one big question. So I would go through the process, just watch it. And then a little bit later, a little bit later I was like, "Oh my god, I gotta do it." I was like, "What's up with that?" And I just kept watching, trying to do it.I'm telling you a story because the first year I was in high school, I played quarterback at texas a&m. When the first game of the season for me was in week 7, I didn't even know if I could play, but I had a game planned out and I had a good time, so I felt like I could play. I was just just trying to prepar...
996|i've been working here for less than three weeks. I've been working here for a year and a half. It was amazing. I was there to work every day until my sister got sick. It was a little crazy, but you know there's so much joy and this is what is possible to it."She had a job, and she had a job, and she made three, and then her husband took her to school."He went out after school and he was really sad and depressed and I got his sister back," Ms. Smith is quoted as saying. "They were in love all the time. It was good to give up on him, but he was so sad because it was his whole family."She was working at a car dealership and the family were looking for someone who would support them through difficult times.And after four long years she was looking for someone to help them move forward."There are three guys who make the most sense to me because of their family," She says, but there are four other guys who make less sense. "There are others who are a little bit more serious, they're just out of the woods somewhere. In america we're all like, 'oh my god.' "She has come across many jobs at a car dealership, at a tech firm, at a job fair with a guy who has a daughter and says he was hired to work at a ca...
997|I was a very young man when we first were married – I was 18 when I wrote my first memoir, and it was only four years ago, a few months before the release of my first novel, I wrote my first book that I called "The love song." The love song is a song with its own song, a song of my childhood. I was raised to believe in love - I loved my sisters, my sisters loved me, my sisters loved me. And, very slowly, they began to love each other. And then one day, with all the love that had happened, my mother took up a book and said, "You have to be kidding. We have a book, we don't need a book." And I just kind of thought, "Well, it's all on my shelf for me. I have to be kidding." I was a little nervous, because I had no clue about love. I had grown up with all the love songs that had been written, but there was no melody to them. This love song was made up of things that had happened. I've never heard of love writing songs. I've never read anything about love. I've never even heard of it. You have to give this book credit - it was my favorite book, and I was very much reading that book until it was finally released. I did like it, but I felt that it just left some room for some things. That is what it was. I can'...
998|I have an older brother of mine who is a little in the 80s and 90s. He is the father of three kids. He was born in 1974. He moved here from his hometown of washington dc at age 26. This is his first home, but it's the right one for him. He started out as a kid and became an expert on the outdoors in high school. We have many friends here that have never met before here.I think it's amazing to see kids come here and enjoy their time on the earth. I think it's amazing to see that we have got so many great experiences here. And I think it's very important to remember that we have a world that is really warm here that we come from. I think that we also have some great people here that can go around at a high level. We have two great teachers here who know how to come up with exciting things. These are the great people that we are.It's not just for me. I think there is something very specific for that people. We have an amazing community here. I know many of you who have been here, but if you look at the big city, you see many cities that have had great communities of artists come here, because all of them have been there for so many years. There is just something very special about our place and our people on this earth.We have a lot of beautiful communities here. In fact, all of u...
999|When the family was about to be sold back to their former owners in the early 1980's, they were told to sell their three daughters to a chinese trader who wanted to buy them some money, and the family decided to buy a house. So here we are, looking for a house of our own in a very small town in a very rural area of southern alberta. My husband owns a house on the property. He sells that house to a chinese guy who sells for a lot of money to a chinese guy for a bit of scrap. All of a sudden, when they start bidding for the house, a chinese guy is selling a lot of money to a bunch of chinese guys who are selling houses which is why we called it 'the longing room'. I didn't have a real estate agent at the time, but I knew a couple of them and they were able to help out. The house started to look very desirable to them. They started looking at everything from the house to the people in the house and the whole town. The house was a little different than they were at the time, so my wife and I just started talking and we started to find out if it was worth it. I decided to call it the shortning room because I felt that if I did the shorting, I might start to see the value of that house and I can see some other properties in the area that could be bought from me."And so we bought it up again. Yo...
